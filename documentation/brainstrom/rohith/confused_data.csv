this is by far the best 2d metroid not only is the game loop refined but the cinematics and story really surprised me samus exudes badass every moment shes on screen must play also the bosses are god damn brutal compared to previous metroids ,1

lacks bit of the soul charm that made ds1 an instant classic but it has some of the best areas in the series and is by far the most consistent game from has ever made from boss standpoint until sekiro released,0

i remember not thinking too much about the original re2 don get me wrong it a great game but with remake re3 and code veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga then came this game in 2019 holy fuck not only was this the first re game played on launch but it just blew me away with how polished it was the police station feels more real than ever with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared the graphics also contribute to this being incredibly realistic yet stylized even if spme faces look bit weird complained about how in the original re playing as both characters wasn worth it because the story barely changed but that completely fixed here not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories but they also have different accessible rooms gameplay segments and even final bosses another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one and although that also the case here both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way this is easily my favorite re game at least until 4 remake comes out and one of my top 5 games of all time so you better believe that wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone ,0

peak fiction one of the best artstyles ve ever seen in modern game,1
the game can be pretty janky and frustating control camera wise and some things may look bad because of what we take for granted on this genre today but when you keep in mind that this game actually created it it actually pretty fucking impressive what hideki kamiya did here the guy is genius,1
probably the complete package but not as fun as double dash or ds new dlc might change this ,0
