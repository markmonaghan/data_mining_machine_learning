the first playthrough of elden ring is one of the best eperiences gaming can offer you but after youve explored everything in the open world and you ve experienced all of the surprises you lose motivation to go exploring on repeat playthroughs which takes lot away from the replayability which is very important thing for from games imo ,0
a replay solidified my love for elden ring so easily my favorite game of all time actually beating malenia this time was also an amazing feeling just love being in this world man its the greatest of all time,1
the game is absolutely beautiful with so much to do the replayability is crazy and it never gets old with it too ,0
took everything great about the soulsborne games and make it 100 better ,1
i play with my overlevelled friend every time and we still fail sometimes he on ng6 insanely difficult game lol n gorgeous graphics animations everything about this game is so beautiful deserves all the hype it gets if you have powerful enough pc definitely recommend you play it on there if you use keyboard you ll want to change the keybinds because the defaults are ass ,0
tied as my favorite souls game with bloodborne truly one ll keep coming back too ,1
convinced this is roguelike for people who do not like the genre the art is technically good but the aesthetic does very little for me too clean or something idk wish liked it but do not,1
incredible art banger soundtrack surprisingly charming storyline and big red dog hades has very smooth gameplay but after playing it for while it just feels like youre doing the same 3 hit combo ove and over again which dont get me wrong that combo feels great to do but once becomes muscle memory you kinda go into autopilot also think the boons are cool but would like to see them change the flow of combat bit more there are some cool ones like the grape boon that can change the way you play but most of them are just upgrades that dont really change the gameplay or strategy other then those 2 small gripes the game is fantastic ,1
não sou muito de jogo indie admito que joguei poucos mas devo dizer que hades foi um dos melhores jogos que joguei na vida facilmente no top 15 toda sua arte dublagem gameplay carisma dos personagens é tudo incrivel,0
i can shake the feeling that am thoroughly bored playing hades ve picked up hades three times over the last few years and three times ve found myself putting down the controller after handful of hours especially after reaching the third stage and couldn figure out why it wasn working for me after giving it few good goes ve finally managed to pin down what it is that just doesn click for me about hades ,0
one of my favorites in the rogue likes lites only being beat by binding of isaac love the characters thanatos my beloved and the writing and the art style and rrraaaahhh this game is awesome,1
a really good switch game however didn really grip me like mario odyssey,0
i was very disappointed by the final boss fight but the rest of the game is so good it makes me not want to even do the final boss fight anyway just so can play more of the game do wish that there were more unique mechanics in combat besides just parrying and link flurry rush but the world is really pretty and actually incentivizes exploring it characters are great story is great and makes you work for it and there tons of hidden secrets and details ,1
sencillamente el mejor juego que he tenido el placer de disfrutar esperé 5 años para poder jugarlo puedo decir que valió cada segundo la espera no estoy ni cerca de conseguir el 100 tengo mas de 100 horas aún estoy descubriendo cosas nuevas va más allá de un simple juego es una experiencia que lamentablemente solo se puede vivir una vez en la vida la recomiendo totalmente ,0
em meio tanto jogo de mundo aberto ruim saindo por aí na última década acho que da pra entender porque breath of the wild chocou tanto as pessoas no ano em que ele lançou realmente eu acho que é melhor mundo aberto que eu já joguei até hoje explorar cada pedacinho desse mundo é tão gostoso parece que tudo aqui tá no mapa tem um propósito para estar lá diferente dos mapas vazios da ubisoft por exemplo acho que unico defeito é esses sistema chatinho de durabilidade das armas ficar trocando de arma tempo todo é tão chato espero que no próximo não tenha ,1
soundtrack is tied for 1 with nier automata super charming story and characters which have become iconic and all that made by 1 man thats it thats the review have no criticisms,0
just play this game dont look at any of these reviews just pick the game up and know nothing else about it if you are one of the lucky ones that didnt get spoiled on the game it will fucking break you in the best of ways,0
whooaa ohh ohhhh ohoohhohh ohhwooaah story of undertale,1
a nice unique take on the rpg indie game format by incorporating really good ideas funny interactions an incredibly subtle story and wonderful music definitely must play if you have not already ,1
this games worldbuilding is incredible with its amazing soundtrack and gorgeous art direction it really makes you feel like you re spiderman one of the best value in gaming tbh this game is packed full of content and none of it feels like filler even the boss rush manages to feel fresh by introducing some surprise bosses boss variants as rewards for beating tough pantheons cant wait to play silksong when turn 80 ,1
this isn just game this is an entire experience n was not too much into metroidvania games and then tried this without any expectation it became one of my favorite games of all time and brought me into the genre now m seeking for similar adventures and can wait for silksong n ve done all 112 in my first run and now m beating the game again then ll aim to master the game on steam and this is the first time game instigated me to do that masterpiece ,1
i like how you can bounce on spikes with your nail good casual game that offers additional challenges for people that are socially challenged,1
a rivetting action adventure game with stunning design extremely rewarding but also gruesomly difficult at times ,0
for each individual aspect platforming exploration combat but the integration and packaging of the content are so good it slightly better that the sum of its parts most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful and many evoke that super metroid gleeful feeling that you ll finally be able to access that new area grab that item or beat that boss the end game challenges reminiscent of wiley fortress and boss rushes after megaman has fully self actualized were the highlight boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master found uses for some charms had written off as not my style to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics my only gripes n the repeated backtracking get it fast travel mechanic that too liberal can erase the environment but this was excessive n some of the charms seemed worthless even after strategizing for boss combat and platforming rushes n in the name of decency and civility make geo sucking ability automatic ,1
muito bom vc pode construir usar sua imaginação mods sobreviver jogar multiplayer até zerar jogo minecraft é um jogo incrível fica melhor cada atualização nunca zerei mesmo depois de muitos anos ,0
baby gammeeee n had the most fun playing when it was first released sory n still fun for couple of hours when playing with people tho ,1
the best game ve played in my life,1
omori is game held up by it heartbreaking emotional story and lifelike characters and ultimately let down by lackluster battle mechanics and gimmicky otherworld ,0
i fucking love air conditioning ,0
didnt close my eyes,0
still not finished but loving the game,1
one of my favorite games of all time it definitely has flaws with it ,1
acing god fucking hate sweetheart castle section but the twist and just overall the characters are so likeable and well written like aubrey kel and hero don really care too much about sunny but he alright guess gets the job done feel basil could definitely use some more screentime the guy rarely gets any in the real world section of the game the writing is,1
have only been metroid fan for couple of years but think this was worth the 19 year wait,1
the most unexpected nintendo release of 2021 pretty good offering by mercury steam while some ideas are questionable like these invulnerable bosses that need to be avoided they do add up to the tension the final boss is unforgiving and punishes hard ,0
the best 2d metroid has been the art design in this one pops out so much you ll remember distinct areas for later the abilities are so fast in this one and some puzzles require some strong thinking even knowing where the item locations are ,1
there was nothing dreadful about this game nothing ,0
context sensitive grappling hooks are hatecrime,0
it a solid party game m bad at lying though and it makes me feel bad not complaint with the game it a complaint with myself that makes it harder for me personally to enjoy,0
lie to your friends simulator,0
im carrying the weight of the wooooooooooooooooooorld,1
nier automata is an unforgettable game androids vs machines all while trying to save humanity and uncover the cold truth of this post apocalyptic world 2b and 9s share common goal but have differing views through the story the combat is more fleshed out than its predecessor due to chips and pod mechanics characters change and face reality after meeting characters and concepts never seen before ,0
this is my favorite game ever and the only game cared enough about to get the platinum trophy in might be biased here but the game has lot of things loved going in like the post apocalyptic setting the game isn perfect and while things like the 9s hacking and route pushed lot of people away still thoroughly enjoyed it getting ending and the final shut em up section in the credits ending with me giving up my save file to protect fellow player is one of the most beautiful moments ve seen in fiction as whole,1
verdadeiro goty 2017 zelda é caralho vai tomar no cu ryuji,0
this game is great and to many people this is probably one of the greatest jrpgs if not overall game of all time see that 100 but personally have my nitpicks with it such as n the pacing of the game n the fact it only gets good 30 40 hours into the game n the fact that essential strategic and most importantly fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid battle n the lack of freedom to do what you want n similar to smt iv iv and maybe other smt persona games idk they sell dlc for super powerful personas in smtiv at least these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them in persona 5 royal they included the dlc which again could ignore if they are optional but can unlike in pervious games there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight up just get these p2w personas naturally which absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window n and more importantly the entirety of kasumi character pre third semester want to punch her ,1
vanilla was my first persona and smt game kinda feels like coming home whenever play it,1
if you have spare 100 hours lying around do this was pretty good 4 better tho ,1
i love goro akechi,1
played like 50 hrs guess finished half or two thirds of it cannot say didn like persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last played some smt games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful especially the 4th however cannot say that persona 5 is bad game although my experience with it was bit rough had this state of waiting for something like 5 10 hours more and something incredible would happen for sure characters pull off some weird moves and the real persona the one everyone is so hyped up about would begin never happened might finish it sometime later tho whenever vibes come back ,0
like nya ,1
one of the greatest games have ever played ,1
god of war is game that understands its audience kratos is now as tired and old as all of us who played the original games back on the ps2 ,0
one of the best games of the ps4 generation that game changes the style of gow saga and it hits in the middle of the target it a master piece the story deep imersive and the world of that gow so vivid and beautiful m not sure if the new gameplay an upgrade but it enjoyable n 9 6,1
this is my fav game of all time everything about it is amazing,1
soy muy tonto scar tissue como dicen los chavales de ahora,0
thought portal was good this game is beyond that this game adds full narrative with characters and guarantee hearing banter between wheatley glad0s and cave johnson k simmons is far better than anything heard today ,1
i not trying to brag but bloodborne wasn much of challenge for me the beginning was little hard since bloodborne mechanics are quite different compared to the dark souls trilogy but few tries and deaths are enough for someone to get used to the way you play ,0
my favourite in the soulsborne series ,1
i have very conflicting opinion of this game that may require me to go back for another playthrough ,0
brilliant incredible amazing show stopping spectacular ,1
perfect,1
the greatest game of all time ,1
my absolute favorite platformer,1
im bad at platforming,0
muito maneiro personagens cativantes o pós jogo chega muitas vezes até ser mais divertido para quem gosta de desafio ,0
one of the imo best gaming experiences you can find to this day the dialouge is adorable and heartfelt the music is utterly stunning and the gameplay and level design is that perfect mix of challenging and fun where you sit there for hours just wanting to complete that one jump doing it over and over and when you do complete it you feel so proud of yourself,1
this is peak it is one of my favorite games its so good not only is the story amazing but side content makes the game feel like real world,1
i wish japan was real,0
super enjoyed this game loved the story and the characters and the entire vibe of it the combat didn super click with me but still had fun beating up enemies and even more fun beating up story characters,1
this game got me back into playing single player games and am eternally grateful for that ,0
overrated as fuck,0
sacrifices fun for the sake of realism,1
portal desolate labs with mind bending puzzles are unforgettable the concept of portals themselves are strange but put into gameplay loops really force you to think with portals ,0
genuinely fun puzzle game that makes me realize my iq is in fact negative but that won stop me from drinking all of the poison goo what it gonna do block my path now already drank it all ,1
a really great game just didn stick out as much as it predecessor 64,1
inspiring how mario can feel so fresh and original after so many years ,1
i played this game so many times dont ever wanna touch it again,1
i mean objectively the best mario game just like galaxy more,0
yeah mario games hit,0
the first 3d mario game have truly loved and completed 100 the near perfection of an already glorious formula ,1
the more mature story by recent pokémon standards lore ramifications for sinnoh and the amazing real time catch mechanics make this game one of the best pokémon games ever easily though good pokémon is still far from being good video game generally speaking the textures are muddy the levels especially alabaster icelands and cobalt coastlands feel janky and overly linear despite the game encouraging more mobile movement and freedom and of course the lack of meaningful presentation through stiff character animations and lack of voice acting hurt this game alot still feel like pokémon gameplay has peaked here but they just don let these games cook long enough and only get away with it because pokémon fans only play pokémon and don branch out to know what actually good,1
really refreshing take on the series just little empty overall ,1
great game but it would be better if there was voice acting and no sudden cutscenes every 2 seconds and it gets pretty bad as you play it but if you re finding good first pokemon game would recommend it tho ,1
aside from obvious performance issues this was easily the most fun ive had with the pokemon series since the release of black white hope we get follow up game in the future that focuses on the unova region and kyurem,0
put me in feudal japan with an iphone and probably wouldn get as far as did here,0
pla the best pokémon game ve ever played and why ll probably never play another pokémon game in my life,1
it was great game all round ending felt little rushed,0
a whole lot of soul put into this game forgot how much really loved hack and slash and especially rhythm musical at the top of it makes it extremely fun was pretty cool story with fun cast overall banger of game and definitely favorites of the year ,1
isso aqui é um absurdo,0
this game came out of no where and felt like it hit me like sucker punch from professional boxer always have soft spot for good rhythm game and hi fi rush hits that spot just right ,1
this game is so jank but so entertaining,1
metal gear rising revengeance review memes raiden memes ,0
feel like would have enjoyed this game much more if hack slash was my kind of game,1
people be rating this 3 bitch be serious ,0
incredible spectacle and movie esque cutscenes backed up by memorable characters inarguably one of the most recognizable games of the decade however is held back by lackluster gameplay ,1
bom jogo importante pra caramba tudo mais mas sinceramente tantas horas de gameplay me divertiram muito mas me recepcionaram na história não que eu eu esperasse algo muito elaborado mas senti que não foi conclusiva ou evoluísse os personagens é divertido muito mesmo a liberdade é ótima passei muito tempo jogando tênis dirigindo pelas colinas fazendo coisas aleatórias a experiência é ótima em pleno começo de 2023 talvez não seja lá grande coisa jogar um jogo assim no sentido de muita coisa legal pra fazer mas na época era uma baita inovação merece respeito pelo que até hoje impressiona ,0
i really wanted to love this game more the playing world is stunning with colorful and great recreations of actual locations and landmarks having to juggle between 3 characters is brilliant idea but found the story to be bit lackluster and overall did not feel as involved with the protagonists as much as was with the previous game ,1
i love the setting lore visuals and the god tier soundtrack but what played of the story was just ok and the side content is very dull m gonna be honest edgerunners baited me into buying this game and it my fault,0
besides the pretty colors and cool rtx visuals this game falls flat on its face if this game was like car it would be 99 honda civic with 5k rims ,1
i thought would enjoy the story didn everything else is n ok n ,1
enjoyable like it when gun goes bang and vibe be like futuristic ,1
deep storytelling intense gameplay beautiful graphics ,0
an amazing sequel to it previous but think the pervious game is superior in the story ,1
a sequel to one of the biggest games of 2018 and it beyond bloated as hell ,0
gow 2018 is my second favorite game of all time right next to the original half life and this was big disappointment ,1
clapped at the end like white people on plane,1
not my fav xb game didn grow attached to the cast in general and overall felt that the game always wanted to show me how great it was compared to the others which didn like ,1
i love this video game,1
most of the content consume doesn affect me emotionally but even experienced an emotional damage from xenoblade chronicles 3 because its world was so depressive and the musics were supporting that depressive atmosphere thanks to tetsuya takahashi great storytelling found myself caring about the characters the story and of course the world ,0
this certainly was long game for context have played xenoblade 1dx and seen 2 on youtube so will mostly probobly be comparing it to xenoblade 1 the concept is immedietly quite interesting although,0
hmmmmmmm kind of divisive one here for me personally while liked the characters the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didn add to much if anything you could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different in that aspect this game was really disappointing the villains were also an absolute joke with the mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and being immensely less cool the more you learn about him in terms of the gameplay though it was certainly fun the class system makes combat very customizable and feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options also did lot of side content in this game which is uncharacteristic of me as beelined it through the first two games exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games and this is no exception perhaps am just getting tired of the series but this definitely didn hit as much as the first or even the second game to me still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh ,0
kirby and the forgotten land is one of the harder games for me to rate the reason for this is what think of the game vs my own personal feelings with the game ,0
keep making games like this hal,1
incredible jump to 3d for the kirby games while still managing to feel like classic kirby title the game makes amazing use of 3d environments to add new layer of exploration and creativity to every single level and had lot of fun clearing the main and extra stories with all bonus challenges while the main content is easy and very chill bonus optional content can be very tricky only thing disliked were few difficulty spikes in some side objectives and the lack of restart from checkpoint button but overall this is masterful game that makes the most out of its simplicity as kirby game but this time you can swallow whole car and spit it unharmed ,0
kirby and the ermmmmm goat n if future kirby games are like this totally wouldn mind that the gameplay is quite honestly an upgrade to the original formula the bosses quite specifically are the most fun fights ve had in quite while great stuff right here,1
perhaps the best kirby game since 64 and roboplanet with great ability upgrades inventive levels great bosses and of course thick layer of cute smothered all over every aspect ,1
replayed with the kids the later levels and the treasure road portals make great use of every power the hidden waddle dees push you to explore sure but also demand perfection for few bosses and the forgotten islands prove the developers knew exactly what they were doing few enemies get additional move sets that expertly increase the pressure if anything wanted dodge move to help me out some more n kept easy on the entire play through and barely scraped by the back part of the game yet it always changing enemy and levels up enough that it never feels repetitive if anything was left wanting just taste more n overall great kirby game and great video game ,0
a captivating journey from start to finish this uses its characters and dialogue to such great effect making everything feel intertwined our protagonist mind especially was so interesting to delve into and finding out little bits and pieces of his identity was just joy to do while the game lets do things without kitsuragi at times never wanted to as he brought much to every scene he was active in very satisfying resolution and to top it off its simply hilarious at times as well n love kim kitsuragi sm,1
i love you kim kitsuragi,1
one of the most interesting politically poignant pieces of art ve ever had the pleasure of consuming,0
i couldn finish day 1 playing this game feels like chore which is never good sign this was my second attempt at finishing the game and actually got lot further than on my first one might pick this up again sometime in the future but don think this game is for me ,1
still unsure whether like the ending or not and for game with some of the best worldbuilding ve ever seen wish more of the game had to do with that world but at the end of the day it still the best writing any game has ever had so can be too mad,0
best spider man game easily only nostalgia can beat it ,1
really makes you feel like spider man,1
just incredible the story tears the gameplays so fun ,1
finally beat this one after 5 years not as enjoyable as the other souls like for me and can really put my finger on it but it was still dark souls so overall good time ,1
perfect ,1
this was fun we played so many times,1
todos os elogios versão original se aplicam aqui porém meu apego pelo nier gestalt não me deixa dar nota máxima pra esse remake sem contar que ele tentou copiar bastante automata isso me desagradou bastante principalmente no visual que eu achava fantástico no original ,0
muito bom porem embora seja um remake ainda continua com uma cara de jogo antigo me prendeu até primeiro final não tankei fazer todos os outros 4,0
nier is such memorable game that changed the ways that stories could be told playing the game again and again to see different perspectives and context is such creative tool when given limited tools the gameplay is fun and is just classic hack and slash with magic tools that are all fun to use against enemies ,1
we all know the importance of this game and what it brought to video games as whole ,0
some fun jumping,1
the perfect sudo conclusion to the series that just takes all of the best elements of mario and expands upon them hot take actually like the camera in this game,1
a masterpiece easily in the conversation of the best game of all time this is coming from someone with no nostalgia tied to it and playing it 27 years after release blown away by how well it holds up especially in terms of level design and platforming the camera was minor nuisance not enough to detract from the value and the controls were not problem aged like wine ,1
i a captain falcon main sadge,0
sakurai gotta stop doing this to urself,1
it is without doubt the definitive version of well refined formula just never had fun playing any of the games in the franchise bought this one hoping the solo mode would deliver unfortunately it never ending grind with very little payoff ,1
fantastic music great art style obviously and really fun gameplay definitely had me picking up the controller again instead of breaking tv call that patience ,1
a great boss rush game with great 1930s cartoony art style the only drawback is the inclusion of linear stages that are too easy and not interesting enough that they shouldn have been included ,1
a brilliant hard but clever and never unfair run and gun shooter the platformer levels were unnecessary and are not as good as the others though ,1
i ve had bit of troubled history with cuphead before now ve tried it on two different occasions both with varying results my first attempt ended pretty swiftly since didn have controller and the keyboard controls are really bad the game didn quite jive with me at that point but my main problem at that point was the hell that is cuphead with keyboard controls year or two later would play through the whole game and later the dlc in co op with friend we did this over steam so there was bit of lag but had controller and friend to help me through enjoyed the game lot more to the point where was the one pushing us to do the dlc together but it still didn quite enamour me like d wanted it to my main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses felt that lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen often with them all acting completely independently have huge amount of trouble processing all of that information so oftentimes found bosses just far too overwhelming not design issue or anything more of personal one ,0
im waiting for this game to grab me but it hasn happened yet n dont know why enjoy dying to the same boss for 3 hours in soulsborne games but not in this game ,1
loved this lot missed the sense of exploration from dark souls but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it other than basic whole number for your damage and health there ,0
o worryi,0
he lack of gear is probably,0
e best t,1
ough people say this is the hardest fromsoftware game but after while it felt much much easier to me tha,1
ark souls n because n there was nothing in my way except my own skill which greatly prefer no main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly don like feeling as if need to grind to make myself better because then it this vague guessing game of numbers there were few points in,1
must have been over levelled or,1
i bought this game on nintendo switch with 20 dollar switch gift card bought myself as end of the school year present just finished sophomore year and life was pretty rough started playing ff7 and my life began to change lil bit was so confused playing it but that just made me want to play it more used to work at summer camp and on the bus ride there would take my switch and play it 40 minutes there 40 minutes back so on average played an hour and 20 minutes day of ff7 ,0
play dragon quest instead,0
honestly not that good as some people say but still interesting and some characters are cool,1
this guy are sick,0
really chill of them to add random encounter toggle and x3 speed setting to accommodate for my rapidly disintegrating frontal lobe,0
what the hell do even say here it ff7 it beautiful story wise at least ,1
mfw bitches and whores,0
i love this game so my review is very biased there are many many flaws with this game given its age for example the decade old naoto trans debate she not she comes to terms with the fact she can be strong self righteous detective and woman the topic is just handled poorly think this game speaks for the improvement in handling similar topics in newer games and that really important regardless this is an absolutely amazing game and one of my favorites of all time and would definitely recommend it to anyone willing to try it n added bonus the soundtrack is awesome,1
naoto is just like me fr fr,1
lo amé todo el tiempo estando jugando el 5 ahora es más lento tosco con mil millones de cosas menos pero la música es mil veces mejor tiene una historia increible,0
genuinely one of the most enjoyable and fun games ever,1
it alright the story is really interesting but the gameplay is bit bland you have to sacrifice your entire hard drive just to install updates every 2 days though,0
i had my genshin phase around the time raiden shogun was announced played lot for while then stopped right before the new dendro area dropped it sallright,1
5 stars for me but let me be really clear this game feels like really big hit or miss feel like there are some misconceptions about this game that if you don come with that bias from the beginning it actually super enjoyable ,1
solid first 12 hours,1
signalis is an absolute treat taking inspiration from the classic survival horror games on playstation 1 developer rose engine has crafted unique experience that will stick with me for awhile ,1
silent hill 2 with lesbians,1
silent hill 2 for lesbians nothing special ,1
got the platinum and did everything on this replay there is no other game quite like this one survival horror masterpiece ,1
i beat this fully in 2 days 7 hours on my first day and 9 on my second day and did promise ending and artifact and im just sitting here basking in it,0
this game is what every resident evil game should strive to be lots of action while also scary at the same time the factory section is bit of snooze fest but thankfully it doesnt last that long and once your done with it the game picks up the pace ,0
resident evil village é oitavo jogo da franquia resident evil continuando história de ethan winters re village se passa 3 anos após os acontecimentos de resident evil 7 ,0
emotional support duke,1
ethan winters is an american hero,1
they got rid of the fun part,1
bro this game is immaculate what else is there to say chef kiss 5 stars yahoo,1
mario peaked here,0
while didn love galaxy as much as other people did it still remains in my eyes as very solid 3d platformer with beautiful graphics and lots of innovations in terms of gameplay at least when compared to previous 3d mario titles ,1
there are almost no bad mario games but galaxy is such slow game that it makes me want to take nap and have actually fallen asleep at least three times while playing,0
the only bad part of this game is matthew perry voice acting,0
probably my favorite wrpg period there is no experiences that can really top this besides the 2 other games in the series before it inception,1
this game is overrated but peak,0
the story is incredibly strong with tons of fun and memorable characters enjoyed going around exploring and learning about the politics and lore of the world also trans girl game trans girl game the only place this game lost significant points with me was in the combat which found fairly tedious and enough of problem enough of the time to seriously take away my motivation to play this game caesar legion is one of my favorite factions in any video game and the elvis impersonators are hilarious really need to go back and get all three main endings ,1
trans rights whooooooooo ,1
my indecisiveness and reluctance to sacrifice one quest for another is the other thing stopping me continuing,1
replayed with my girlfriend still the best game of all time nothing compares,1
the more think about this game the more love it and realize how unique it is n such an amazing feeling exploring this solar system contemplating the infinite dark space with the beautiful score playing so satisfying to unravel the mysteries and to understand what you need to do especially when you need to be little bold there a big sense of cohesion in this whole game n the ending is really powerful and you can really feel that you re witnessing something big n it not my personnal favorite game of all time yet feel like it might the best game ever made if that makes sense ,1
my favorite game ever,1
the most engaging puzzles riddles ive ever seen in game solutions are very clever but not unfair exploring the planets and their ruins and stumbling on all kinds of crazy shit is great time and unraveling the mystery one step at time so you can piece together the bigger picture is incredibly satisfying the environment design is also amazing and the concepts in the later portions of the game are so cool and interesting cant elaborate because of spoilers the dlc is just okay though ngl exploring the setting was cool but it felt like lot of running around doing busy work for very little reward,1
fantastic game from start to finish the curiosity and confusion in the beginning before you experience and realize the loop for the first time is breath of fresh air not much direction just some input from npcs about space mission and before you know it you are uncovering secrets of fallen race and the death of the universe the experience is underlined with fantastic score and the design of the puzzles is great it a bit tiresome when you get stuck and feel like you re just too dense to progress but when things fall in place and do make sense it fantastic when you finally piece everything together know exactly what you need to do and where is an undescribeable feeling this is very much as close as you can get to perfect game,0
my entry point of the series don ask this remake of my first entry of the series and causing it to grow my love for the series in general this game is really really good and had fun time overall when playing this game and since m rating this out of pure nostalgia of raccoon city and overall experience think this game really deserves 5 stars but when playing this game got really bad luck with its rng of mr and some lickers since they actually keep killing me and at one point made somewhat of stun lock move so have to take out half star but it still worth playing since it is very beautiful upgrade to the game played as kid and it as good as remember,0
a really well done vision of what survival horror games could be and great remake of this beloved classic in general ,1
i dont have much to say but really like this game its what you expect from resident evil ,0
peak survival horror,1
lembro de ter jogado no ano de lançamento ter ficado encantado com toda imersão do jogo de um ar obscuro que já havia visto em resident evil 7 após anos decidi jogar original percebi tantas novas camadas daquela época que comecei ser mais critico em comparação esse jogo agora em 2023 retornei jogar platinei jogo também percebi que por mais que ele apresente problemas ele é impressionante ,0
recomendado aunque se hace muy repetitivo ,1
i really want to like this game but the gameplay doesnt really change much if you played it for an hour you ve pretty much seen it all ,1
ripped and teared,0
fun but fucking annoying,0
shoot kill move reload shoot kill move reload move shoot move reload move shoot kill move reload never stop moving ,0
the more think about this game the more like it tbh like the changes to combat and this game actually made me want to do physical build for the main character which did and was fun went for true neutral ending might get around to doing the other endings after playing some other smt games nahobino based,0
like pokémon but funner,1
after having played several entries in the smt franchise was incredibly hyped for this game overall it didn meet my expectations set by prior entries ,0
i love the gameplay character designs and music but the story of this game was distractingly awful even though the narrative isn ever really the forefront of smt when dazai took off his hat and slicked back his hair after lost my mind he is truly the law rep ever,0
this was the first atlus game decided to try out and had pretty good time it a really fun monster collector with some fantastic music an incredibly fun combat system with tons of expression and some pretty great presentation theres just level of quality here that appreciate n sooo n much you can really tell they polished the 𝗦𝗛𝗜𝗧 out of this game imma big fan ,1
great but hate the cheap one hit kill qtes very pronounced lack of enemy variety that gets amended in later titles in the series,0
beat em all at its best with weird and frankly off putting enemy design ,0
at this point lost the count of how many times played this game,0
played for like couple hours and got board ðÿ xadðÿ xad n it was fun during those hours tho ðÿ ,1
amazing harvest moon story of seasons like game ,1
guys how do marry willy guys,0
harvest moon without the patriarchal religious theming that makes those games interesting essentially just carnist busywork that panders to gay zoomers,0
the story is up its own ass but still has its good moments gameplay carries this game hard why cant developers just add roguelike modes to their games to let you infinitely explore games mechanics as much as you want with no interruptions ,0
deeply regret letting friends convince me to sink my life into the mediocre stealth action game wrapped in 30 hours of rock stupid misery porn that is the last of us 2 wish d just played another life is strange for 100 less psychotic lesbian smooch sci fi story game in 1 3 of the time ,0
lets be serious anyone who hates this is closeted gay man,0
beautiful looking game and excellent gameplay that more in depth and challenging than the original the pacing is so bad there are several character motivations that fall flat aren executed the best and the ending is almost unbelievable motivation wise but the themes and good story moments stick with you and acting is top notch across the board will revisit this again at later date for the grounded playthrough after which ll update my thoughts and go more in depth ,0
what did like ,1
you know game is that good when even the tank controls don suck masterpiece in nearly every way imaginable ,1
fuck tha puzzles man ,0
peak atmosphere let down heavily by gameplay that way too easy and lets down the incredible tension built by the writing environments and sound design if bloober were competent they just copy and paste the entire game and increase enemy movement speed and reduce ammo by 20 or something like that,1
if hadn learned the plot twist would have given 5 ,0
the best game ever made that other games will forever try to live up to and fail ,0
one of my favorite games of all time incredible open world with some of the best side quest stories in any video game the game is full of compelling characters that make the world feel alive and interesting it the antithesis of ubisoft open world games it a world you are compelled to explore and learn more about not world where you re just ticking boxes sometimes the open world is arguably too much it a daunting game and difficult to recommend unless you have the time to fully engross yourself in it the only complaints ever had was that the combat is bit clumsy but you get used to it as fan of the books loved experiencing real continuation of many of the stories told in the books also gwent rules n n disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 7 years ago ,1
wind howling,1
great writing and worldbuilding unfortunately the gameplay gets stale quickly the combat is floaty and controlling geralt feels delayed unresponsive ,0
everytime beat this game feel bitter sweet and empty after because the writing and characters are so good that you forget your time with them is limited ,0
é meu jogo favorito da vida tenho um puta apego emocional mas tem vários defeitos tipo controle do carpeado pelo fator replay que ao fazer as mesmas missoes pelo menos tres vezes ja chega ser enjoativo ,0
masterpiece,1
just play royal instead bro why reading this ,0
literally best game ever till they released persona 5 royal goro akechi defender,1
persona 5 changed me didn play jrpg or games too often until played this one everything about p5 oozes with flair looked at the flashy ui design and was shocked as ve never seen something so creative before ,0

i ve tried playing this game for 80 hours stopped after was bored to death and still unsure was actually following the actual storyline or if there even was any ,0
i have had lot of fun in skyrim just wandering around and making up my own story in my head but the moment run into fully authored quests my enjoyment dips vastly,1
special edition da anniversary edition da bunu da oynadım tam olarak eşi yok sanırım eşi yok demez bu oyun inanilmaz harika demek degil sadece aynı özgürlük ve immersion veren bir oyun bulamadım keske ilk oynadıgım zamanlara geri dönebilsem ,0
everyone got their game day of release but amazon delivered mine 4 days late and that honestly killed my ability to get excited about anything for the rest of my life felt iconic at the time though didn it ,1
esse jogo é muito bom dos jogos de speedrun esse é mais divertido n história desse jogo é legalzinha não compre esperando um jogo com história complexa tocante é uma história bobinha só para não deixar os personagem estarem ali só por estar n melhor parte do jogo é definitivamente gameplay o level desing esses dois fatores combinam tão bem juntos que depois de se acostumar ao jogo mesmo sendo primeira vez na fase tu já vê um possível atalho ou ate mesmo um segredo n acho esse jogo muito pouco reconhecido tanto que eu só fui descobrir que ele lançou 4 meses depois do seu lançamento ,0

rack is incredible the game has an arcade dreamcas,1
ing the way forward to get the best times if this game was just level select screen think it might be my favorite game of the year thus far but sadly this game has one major flaw and that is the plot it an incredibly stereotypical anime amnesia plot full of boring psychopathic enemies cringy sexual innuendos and awful voice acting yes know the guy who played spike is in it but this is not his best performance ended up muting the voice audio and that helped quite bit but the plot still has nothing to offer if you skip all the cutscenes though think this game is definitely must play this gets 4 stars because of the great artstyle tier machine girl music interesting gameplay gimmics and great level design 1 star for the story and visual novel aspects neon white é uma mistura de fps com visual novel pode parecer uma mistura estranha primeiro momento n mas depois de alguns minutos de gameplay esse jogo vai sugar sua alma até os segundos finais da gameplay n agora pega isso coloca um toque de speedrun pronto neon white n gameplay é absurdamente pra,0

re4 is good game and revolutionized third person shooters at the time but this is not survival horror never once felt any tension playing this game and thats why play resident evil,1
the game that got me hooked on the resident evil series ,0
a game that manages to perfectly blend the survival horror formula that resident evil popularised with something resembling what was at the time the future of the third person genre every aspect of it is designed to ramp up the tension and keep you in this sweet spot of just about surviving the horrors by the skin of your arse there a reason the controls are like that the guns feel like that the enemies react like that the music sounds like that everything is geared towards making you feel like the game is constantly turning the screw and thanks to the adaptive dificulty it usually fucking is ,1
cotland parker kennedy this was the first resident evil game played and finished it remained as such for over 15 years they were at bingo,0
what good fucking villain ,0
man they dropped the ball still good tho,1
masterpiece,1
remake de um clássico da história dos jogos respeita jogo antigo não faz mudanças bruscas ao mesmo tempo que moderniza gameplay a deixa bem mais parecida com actions rpg atuais com the witcher 3 ff xv no mais jogo se prolonga demais em algumas partes desnecessáriamente a história acaban progredindo de maneira extremamente lenta fazendo com quem em algumas partes jogo se torne extremamente monótono,0
hate to be hater but man did hate this may as well lean into it by far one of the least pleasurable and enjoyable experiences ve ever had with video game in any capacity with anything really spread out and torturous over 30 aching hours determined to finish this and think it counts for something this is my first experience with final fantasy so can say how entirely faithful it is to the original know the big plot beats but like really this is the story that hit for so many people even in the differences this remake brings n really do just have too much to say about this and don really know where to begin about it all for the positives this is obviously incredible looking and uhhh yeah really like barrett but other than that it a struggle this thing really is emblematic of so many issues have with lot of gaming in general so self serious with huge misses when attempting anything light refuse to believe there are honest to god wedge stans out there giving us so many cinematics having the gameplay consist of another 5 or so steps along corridor and bam here another cutscene dialogue and vocal direction sucks cloud is an absolute black hole of charisma nobody is fun to play as except for barrett who has the most simple combat systems out of the 4 options ,0
recomendado,1
sonic frontiers é mais novo jogo do sonic porém ele não é só mais um jogo qualquer da franquia é nova direção da série sendo tão diferente quanto adventure unleashed mas será que sonic frontiers é um bom jogo mesmo com algumas polêmicas resposta é sim ele é um ótimo jogo ,0
maybe ll try again in the future but this isn doing it for me it was alright at first but soon outstayed it welcome ,1
excited for the sequel assuming they don completely change the formula again because this is really solid foundation that feels fresh if little bare bones at times super fun to run around and the music is really nice glad to have story where the characters take the events seriously without joking every 5 seconds the story itself is ok but the final act is clearly unfinished and rushed has probably one of the worst final bosses in the whole series which really undermines the ending bit excited for the content updates sega needs to give these devs the time and resources to release game in fully finished state ,1
man kinda forced myself to beat this kinda fun tho,1
wow really fucking cool game honestly the most fun card game ve ever played and it worked in every iteration want full versions of each ngl so fun ,1
one of the best games from 2021 hate card battle games but this one has me excited to come back for more ,1
the card game itself is good the elements beyond the card game take it up notch,1
its hard to say alot about what like about this game without spoiling it but it a must play to me incredibly fun card system interesting narrative and story that goes deeper then you expect best played blind ,1
the story is amazing and the atmosphere really helps to get inmersed in this world where your life depends on how you play your cards n still need to finish the kaycee mod but for now it completed to me,1
peak near flawless game for me and really encapsulates what love about the medium exceptional effort and turned out just as well as d hoped ve beaten it 5 times now granted new game plus with all your upgrades and knowing where to go makes it much easier did find it to be very difficult at points and it can be somewhat easy to get lost also vital system for progression can be too cryptic but rewarding once you crack it that about my only gripes must play game gorgeous artstyle no handholdy nonsense fun gameplay top tier ost great story and an overall perfect action adventure game it littered with secrets as well so your exploration is rewarded pay attention to the manual andrew shouldice goated fr 5 5 ,1
tunic is wonderful 2d zelda like that feels like love letter to the genre between an extremely charming aesthetic fun and interesting items and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre the inclusions of things like made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were kid trying to play game like link awakening discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing level design is top notch in this game and love all the secrets and hidden paths they provide using the game isometric view think the weakest parts of this game compared to its contemporaries is the mood of the game ,1
esse é único jogo que eu me motivei platinar é rápido tranquilo divertido os mistérios desse jogo meu deus eu nunca vi nenhum jogo apresentar suas mecânicas dessa forma coisas que você poderia fazer desde início mas só foi aprender na metade por isso que voltar nos lugares é tão incrível porque você volta diferente com conhecimento tunic pra mim foi uma experiência única onde eu pensava sim que ia gostar mas não imaginava nem de longe as coisas que ia me fazer sentir minha opinião sobre esse game é algo pessoal demais é com certeza meu indie preferido ,0

i have bad habit of not beating video games even though haven beaten ocarina of time ve gotten far enough into it to tell that it good and if you need me to tell you that it good then you re bit of silly little guy goober if you will,0
as years go by still enjoy this succesful transition from 2d to 3d of the series but its rather formulaic structure make me prefer bolder approaches such as subsequent episodes ,1
childhood game and probably played it about 8 times through timeless classic n remaster is good too but never finished it,1
the very last fight against ganon not ganondorf felt so good nintendo knows how to make game it felt very powerful and nearly shedded tear ,1
i love lesbians,1
yeah it good,1
going to give an 8 until realizes the alternative route brilliant stuff let see what you got toby fox ,1
peakrune literalmente me diverti muito jogando historia que toby fox esta cozinhando me faz ficar mais interessado ainda para os proximos capitulos o que vai acontecer,0
rivetting story great graphics and music an alignment of planets and star studded development team all time classic ,1
i ve never enjoyed turn based combat but chrono trigger got pretty close to making me enjoy it unfortunately it did not succeed and most of what you do in the game is combat the visuals and music are great though the writing is fine suppose appreciate the little details in it just have the feeling that woolsey wasn given the ability to translate things as well as he could have in better circumstances and it drags down the writing for me ,1

a very good game that still holds up well more than 20 years later it delivers everything that made the previous game good with consistent improvements to gameplay and visuals ,1
teenage me thought this game was so perfect and brilliant and she would be so disappointed in 30 year old me for thinking it kind of mess,0
this game goes hard as fuck,0
muito bom um dos melhores plataformas jogos do super nintendo muito revolucionário para sua época ,1
eu só zerei rapidão pelo caminho da estrela mas esse jogo continua foda n óbvio não é meu mario favorito mas ele continua fodastico um dos melhores jogos de plataforma 2d ,1
i love mario games so much love super mario world music art mechanics level design enemies everything this is just nice game could play with friend watching or even as player 2 and it makes me happy ,1
long review short masterpiece ,1
a timeless classic it might not be as shiny and frantic as its biggest competition at the time sonic the hedgehog but its depth size and replayability made it stand out still one of the all best in the mario series ,0
one of my all time fav games ever love everything about it,1
probably one of the nicest looking games ve seen but other then that it definitely not for me ,1
i actually really like this game ,1
good game but literally glorified dlc make it atleast 30 euro or something,1
exaggerated swagger,0
it like spider man ps4 with worse story but better gameplay you think that would even out but really didn enjoy the story ,1
não sei se é impressão minha mas achei web swing o combate desse tão bons quanto os do original parecem mais fluidos sei lá miles é um baita personagem a história é simples mas efetiva uma pena só ser tão curto quando menos percebi já tava na última missão mas vale muito pena ,0
i think this is my third or fourth attempt at beating this thing farthest got to was ornstein and smough but did it finally man what an experience true it was rocky road in some parts some of the later game areas obviously didn get as much attention as the first half and some bosses were pretty disappointing and one was straight up bad but everything else is excellent weighty satisfying combat incredible atmosphere some of the best level design ve ever had the pleasure of exploring incredibly deep lore that absolutely did not fully understand but did my best fun memorable bosses and enemies this game has it all man this is now the second fromsoft game ve beaten bloodborne being the other one overall prefer bloodborne but this is still an incredible game worthy of your time ,1
the birth of genre it has lot of warts lot of objectively terrible bosses and the lack of warping between all bonfires never stops being annoying but you know what it dark souls bitch when it good it great ,0
i should ve thought about the crashes before bought it on switch ,0
its not that hard,0
i think the rolling health meter is unique fighting mechanic this game has inspired some of my favorite modern rpgs and the sound design art is really creative ,1
a classic no better way to put it say fuzzy pickles ,1
scandalously never released in europe before the classic snes mini fantastic rpg with phenomenal and meta backstory full of fun thrills not so simple fighting mechanic and absolutely lovely characters only outperformed by its even more fantastic sequel ,1
un rpg extraordinario el modo de juego la mecánica de combate es más bien estándar pero el argumento funky camp naive inesperadamente crudo con el que construyen el juego es maravilloso si lo hubiese jugado hace años estoy seguro que no lo habría disfrutado tanto como ahora ,0
doidera pra caralho tudo nesse jogo é bom industria dos videogames peakaram quando aquele castelo aparece do de cabeça para baixo os unicos defeitos são desse jogo é sua idade pois mecanicas designs desse jogo são um pouco outdated mas isso é detalhe o jogo continua sendo 10 10,0
muito se diz sobre coisas feitas com amor carinho mas poucas coisas merecem tanto esse elogio quanto symphony of the night,0
sempre tive um carinho imenso por este título symphony of the night é simplesmente primeiro jogo que eu tive contato na minha vida consequentemente obra que me introduziu esta mídia que não só é minha favorita dentre outras que eu também gosto muito como filmes música mangás etc mas que acabou se tornando uma das minhas maiores paixões no geral ,0
the birth of metroidvania excellent game and cool features no more words just play that game bro n 9 9,1
notes n ending acquired good ending n played only as alucard n around 185 completion,0
atmosphere visuals and the osts in this game are awesome and helps the immersion stay consistent throughout the game the gameplay is very good for people who wanna start this genre recommend this game fully ,1
un remake con la movilidad de dread sería la mera verga ,0
it is super and metroid game,1
this is tough review to write because it hard to say what hasn already been said growing up wasn as keen on search action games as am now but my recent playthrough of n super metroid n few years ago changed that n the exploration is very well done here as many others have said the detail on the spritework is astronomical for the snes and the atmosphere is otherworldly the boss fights are pretty challenging and fun my only draw was that didn like maridia and found it very frustrating but every other area especially lategame norfair was very enjoyable an amazing game for surely ,1
probably still the best 2d metroid entry to this day several mechanics were introduced with this game which is timeless classic ,1
can deny that the game did lot for the platformer genre but nowadays don really consider it anything special n but it has the most iconic first stage of any platform game ever ,0
entendo importância desse jogo pra industria mas não ele definitivamente não é bom ,0
best 6 minutes ever,1
i love this games atmosphere nintendo should lean into this style more often ,1
copy paste my ocarina review never finished but it had an impact on me regardless ,1
i dropped this originally went back and had lot of fun not life changing but good time,1
finally finished for jedi survivor tbh im actually kind of excited enjoyed the story and most of the characters n the gameplay is solid just hate the slow walking through cracks and big problem is in the first half of the game having to walk back to the mantis after finishing level n is so damn annoying ,0
wait ea actually managed to make high quality single player star wars game n n surprise to be sure but welcome one ,0

there is just notthing you can complain about in this game the characters the story the ending it is all so fucking perfect ,0

rating 9 2 10 amazing,1
re logic am begging you please make the actual final update,0
uncontested standard for this game genre bitches got everything right down to the exact feel of everything,0
the only issue have with this game is the dull generic enemies and lack of engaging combat ,0
great game to play with friends watching little short but very dense and have great replay value ,1
as traditional american horror tale it is masterfully conceived as game it works for some time and it starts running out of oil around the third act ,1
despite re7s commercial success this is probably one of my least favorite games ve ever played it so detached from what gave resident evil its charms that it just feels more like poor attempt at making an outlast game with guns in it it was nice that the series gained more popularity and returned to its proper horror roots but this isn for me and it never will be ,1
sei que vou ser só mais um chatão que não amou por isso aquilo mas eu tenho meus problemas com este jogo não gosto muito do combate tanto pelos inimigos repetitivos quanto pelas armas sistema de combate em si n não é exatamente uma coisa que jogo faz de muito errado mas eu também não gosto de os itens serem tão bem escondidos algumas vezes pois tem alguns em cantos que você nunca olharia por um lado é bom para recompensar exploração mais minuciosa mas por outro é muito anti intuitivo n atmosfera do jogo a ambientação são ótimas mas eu sinto que focou demais no terror na opressão às vezes até no grotesco bizarro isso meio que me tira um pouco diversão tratando se de um resident evil onde uma das coisas que mais gosto é gerenciamento de itens definir mais combate que se você está nervoso com um inimigo que você não consegue enfrentar direito por ele ser muito resistente ser um saco acertar na cabeça n no mais acho um bom jogo com bons personagens com um rumo que não foi ruim pra franquia algumas coisas foram bons rascunhos pro próximo então foi muito mérito este game apesar de eu não sentir um fator replay deste ,0
story will leave you with actual phantom pain but the gameplay is unmatched in the action stealth genre ,0
preparing for missions and utilizing all the unique gear are the best parts of mgsv the game does nothing to justify its open world structure though and adds unnecessary grinding for materials to upgrade your base which bogs down the gameplay ,0
it hard to review this game it has the best gameplay in the series easily but that constantly interrupted by helicopter rides visits to mother base selecting your loadouts even though for me it was the same loadout for almost every mission and micromanaging your many recruits still while you re actually in the field the stealth gameplay feels excellent but then it has the absolute worst story in the series on the plus side kinda the vast majority of the story is on cassette tapes that are completely optional ,0
only 10 15 hours into this game and already it ,1
some of my worst memories in playing videos games from this,0
sucks that this game didnt really get the support updates it needed to stay alive for as long as like league or something cause this was genuinely unironically the best multiplayer fps game ever during it peak,0
when played this game was when it where in the most boring meta ever existed barriers go pam ,0
for the sake of my sanity we will not be discussing all that this game did to and for me ,0
has winton 5 5,1
when was younger and heard people talk about it always scuffed it and thought it was some lame ass shit but was fucking wrong ,0
half life 2 hasn aged day was surprised at how well it held up almost 20 years after its original release nostalgia has nothing to do with it it just that good ,1
when played this remember being like aaaah get it now but now remember nothing about it ,1
intelligent systems best work so far top quality voice acting strongest soundtrack since radiant dawn and echoes fun gameplay good challenge immersion was handled well n although designed to be re play too much content is shared between the different routes story is not bad however it does not affect negatively the whole experience n this game was released during very important part of my life it came out when needed it the most gave me the emotional support needed highly recommended,1
great but don like when it tries to be persona,1
yes like all three four counting yuri of the lords almost equally yes we exist still need to finish blue lions aha ,1
played like 50 hours before beating blue lions campaign loved the specific story and characters got and the twist half way thru was super cool gameplay was tight and good evolution from awakening satisfied with my run for now but one day know log back and try the other two classes ,1
my profile is mostly goofy but honestly love fe3h ve purchased the dlc followed all of the routes beaten the game multiple times and poured sad amount of hours into it chose mercedes as my first romance option and she still my favorite this game genuinely makes me very happy and have never played any other fire emblem game before ,1
went into this game for the pretty ladies and came out traumatized by war,0
i thank this game for my childhood introduction to classic rock ,1
top 5 games of all time,1
jogava mais pra ficar explodindo os outro modo historia nunca me chamou atenção,0
have two number 9s number 9,0
a visual novel combined with strategy tower defense gameplay n it was good but the replay value is rather limited ,0
this has become my favorite visual novel storyline and possibly top 15 storyline in general love sci fi stories than can creat elaborate worlds like this do wish the gameplay was more interesting tho ,1
it is not perfect it a bit too heterosexual and there are parts of the ending have issues with but tiny itty bitty little issues like that just do not matter in the face of one of the greatest narrative experiences have ever experienced this is seriously revolution in interactive storytelling and if you have even the slightest interest in it then you should play it as soon as possible its especially an absolute treat for anyone who loves to think about how game design can influence and bolster the narrative games try to convey,0
i love video games so fucking much,0
i had heard lot of things about persona 3 difficulty and its age but came out without bitterness but deep emotion within my heart ,0
changed my life memories of you still makes me cry literally unexplainable how much this game means to me also aigis,0
the best definitive version of the game pretty good all in all wonderful game,1

que jogo lindo n é bem punitivo dante tem vida de papelão mas combate é muito livre no inicio é dificil pra burro mas depois que você adquire skills pro devil trigger pro dante vai facilitando ficando muito mais dinâmico câmera é um inimigo mais no jogo mas compensa com direção de arte foda ótimo inicio de franquia sim eu serei covarde vou pular 2 como um bundão não achei meu tempo no lixo ,0

the only reason its this high is because was little pussy that abused save states every time died,0
mario kart 8 deluxe is nearly identical to the past 3 mario karts before it the only real bonus is that it on the switch and even then is that honestly bonus,0
raising this to 3 5 stars after playing the dlc the racing and courses are great just wish there were some other single player modes the mario sports games get fairly criticized for lack of modes but mario kart often manages to avoid that criticism after few days of repeating the same courses over and over feel ready to move on to another game ,0
yeah this is banger and the best mario kart really great visuals and smooth gameplay and having so many different courses and bringing back classics from every console is an absolute blast,0
i a real critic,0
this is what happens when make fun engaging lol fe game with lot of customization well balanced without the dlc challenging actually good map design memorable and fun characters with lot of personality,1
this game is silly but the gameplay was really nice can really put my thoughts in to words because don really have any thoughts my head was completely empty while playing this game and it worked on it favor n still didn surpass ronde so that an for this game but other than that it pretty good,1
nice looking vibrant colours really fun gameplay excellent voice acting solid soundtrack especially during solm chapters decent challenge ,1
took me 40hours to beat n really enjoyed the mechanics of gameplay liked the emblem idea lot it allows for some really cool and powerful unit combinations and creations thought the story was whatever it was fine bad dragon vs good dragon and hated the characters some of the least engaging characters ve ever interacted with ,1
was fun but like that story was dookie,1
it quite difficult for me to gather my thoughts into single opinion because n pokémon violet n gives me lot of positive emotions but at the same time it is not at all devoid of negative ones ,0
another game being damaged by having crunches and small development timespan frame rate being intolerable and had the game crash 3 times on me still had good time playing it the open world and actually having the freedom to travel with having better story to follow keeps this from being one of the weakest of the series ,0
tinkaton my beloved,1
saying how good this game is for me feels like my dad talking about how the car he owns from 2006 is incredible and full of stories as long as you ignore the fact it almost falls apart the minute it gets on the road except this game came out last year ,1
this could have been the best pokémon game if there wasn so many bugs would prob give 5 5 if no bugs,0
extremamente divertido violência extrema estética incrível músicas boas não existe uma maneira melhor de descrever esse jogo n eles consegue transformar ato de matar cruelmente em algo extremamente divertido n jogo é desafiante mas na medida certa você não vai demorar pra pegar jeito do jogo se transformar em um verdadeiro maníaco que sai matando qualquer um que simplesmente esteja andando n história não é tão bem explicada nesse jogo no 2 eles explicam melhor as coisas mas mesmo assim ela é muito boa vale apena caso não tenha entendido ver algum vídeo explicando ela n as máscaras são melhor coisa do jogo fazendo que basicamente cada pessoa tenha um estilo próprio de jogo n mas pra você que gostou do jogo eu tenho uma pergunta do you like hurting other people ,0
good gameplay actually adictive,1
i remember thinking wow it ,1
a healthy normal person does not much you can say about hotline miami that hasn already been said it is iconic confident violent and tuned perfectly it easy to appreciate title this well made ,1
takes little getting used to but man this game is fun when the controls start to click the art style is amazing and totally nails what it was going for if had to complain about anything guess there one or two level gimmicks didnt love golf but either way this game is still sick ,0
a very solid game that knows what it wants to achieve and does it with style the controls take some getting used to but oh man when it clicks n it really clicks n n didn like the bosses as much as the levels but the final boss was amazing ,1
wow,1

 played before 2023 n the best platformer out there love that powers are intermingled lot of the times into exploration and combat which is fantastic especially in comparison to the other platformers out there the story and world is great with fantastic characters voice acting and an art style that is wonderful the concepts they create in these worlds is insane and don think double fine is praised enough for their abilities to do it and think everyone should play this game it is the only platformer ve ever truly one hundred percented and completed all the achievements something ve never truly done before especially without guide ,1
the game of psychonauts 2 is fine it drags in the middle and the environments get boring somehow maybe do to the linear nature of most minds the gameplay itself is solid there re more dimensions to combat than the game initially lets on so figuring out how to go about fights is rewarding even though they re simpler platforming is responsive and the environments at least offer interesting ways to use platforming ability from time to time think this balances out to an overall fine experience it a 1 foot deep pool of game but the water is at least nice ,1
that nintendo just announced this and dropped it in the same day is crazy the prime games has been games that has forever been stuck on my backlog now was the golden opportunity for me to finally play the first one wow this is one of the best remasters ve played it should be considered remake how they did the controls is so underrated having the choice to play with og controls the wii version motion controls or as modern fps this is must buy especially for new player ,1
my history with the metroid series is mostly recent had barely touched metroid before decided to play super metroid leading up to dread release ,1
never played prime game before was actually waiting for such release since the switch release n it is definetely good the whole first 2 hours of the game is peak pacing and progression after that it sadly devolves to n standard metroidvania loop of backtracking and collecting further upgrades know it unfair to compare it to dread but that game had way better pacing the music is banging the visuals are super impressive for switch hardware which is already showing it age with games like bayonetta 3 for example n like it despite my gripes with some of the backtracking and the absolute trash boss that is meta ridley especially after beating the best bosses in gaming sekiro also the inability to skip cutscenes in 2023 release it quite iffy n collecting lore also heavily reminded me of outer wilds which guess is the game that was influenced by prime n other than that very intriguing take on metroid fps game ll definetely try 2 and 3 whenever they are coming to switch and 4 if it ever graces the console ,1
es un juego muy adelantado su época al jugarlo no he podido evitar compararlo con juegos mucho más modernos eso habla muy bien de este juego ya que es tan bueno que la industria se ha fijado ha seguido sus enseñanzas n me gustaría indagar mucho más en los archivos demás pero no lo he ido haciendo durante la run por ir toda leche juegarral 10 10,0
this is my first time playing this game have already played metroid prime 2 and 3 so this wasn a mind blowing experience it is impressive how much they got right the first time though this game doesn feel like it lacking much of anything besides fast travel m also shocked about how cool samus suit kept getting haven seen any cosplay or drawings of that phazon suit it was nice surprise ve heard lot about the music in this game and yes it is great ,1
one of these days halo will understand what makes fps games fun,1
its whatever brah rip bungie fuck 343,0
as newcomer to the halo series this was awesome had lot of fun with it and the multiplayer was pretty solid too get that long time halo fans are crying and shitting their pants over this game but tbh it feels unwarranted ve never found halo to be particularly compelling as sci fi an adventure story war story or really anything it trying to be so wasn expecting much going in the story is boring asf but any game with grappling hook and no fall damage is doing good things ,0
i heard lot of work went into this game must be pretty good,1
terrible trend chasing open world campaign broken promise of cutting split screen campaign terribly outdated multiplayer that refuses to change this game tarnishes the legacy and respect that halo once had ,0
it just not fun,1
great game the combat is overly enjoyable and the story are nice all the boss fights are basically the same which makes me sad ,1
17 9 hours to complete n fucking love this game the combat mechanics are top tier this was the first game completed when was kid and its still great replaying it ,1
mark hamill is in it,0
honestly this game is so perfectly linear with collectibles that encourages you to explore great crafted rich environment absolutely shame that each game just stuffs more and more side content that takes away from the game and slowly removes itself from the gothic art style in favour for bland gritty realism,0
awesome expect when itâ not but when it isðÿ œðÿ œðÿ œðÿ ,1
i remember playing this game and enjoying it but it was long enough time ago don want to give it rating ,1
jogo bugado pra caralho fases confusas que não deixam claro que é pra fazer partes especiais sem f u d são verdadeiro inferno controlar mario por aí é confuso muitas outras coisas eu poderia ficar dia inteiro falando mal do sunshine ,0
the long jump being taken out is step top far never do that again,1
belter waited so long in my life to play this wish had it as kid great use of toads ,1
you need to play this game dont wait for nintendo to do bring it over pick up rom and an emulator and play this game it is an experience that will only be tainted when nintendo gets it grubby hands on it when it localizes it,0
mother 3 es de esos rpg que la gente comenta es de los que me hacen llorar geniunamente el final casi que logra hacerme llorar pero igualmente estaba muy movido por dentro el juego tiene unos escenarios preciosos un arte banda sonora geniales para una consola como la gba geniunamente aprovecha el potencial de la consola tanto para detacar cada ambiente donde cada uno es unico tanto de manera positiva como la negativa para dar entender lo que propone ,0
mother 3 is the perfect jrpg,1
stuck in limbo mother 3 is perfect experience feelings of grief revenge and change are all highlighted here in rapidly industrialized world lucas and friends have to find the source of this all while trying to move on from their painful memories the game portrays emotion with beautiful animations and well timed text boxes ,0
i dont think enjoyed the overall game as much as earthbound but its different style of game earthbound is sillier and this game is very serious however this game is insanely good an incredible ending lots of weirdness along the way and memorable characters that are all incredibly well written cant recommend it enough,1
i had my share of fun with this but m afraid it ll have the same fate as rumbleverse though this time it looks more justifiable,0
rip to this game had potential but backlashed from the community for the right reasons still had fun and got the platinum so it a win win ,1
o jogo tinha bastante potencial vendo quanto de franquias warner tem mas ele acabou por ter muitos problemas somado com demora nas atualizações fica complicado,0
i liked nick smash more,1
abandonware wanted to love it but too many issues with online latency make some matches very unplayable and couldn stick it out the community has given up on it as have ,0
it really feels as though they struck gold when they first began creating this game while the story is very simple almost shounen manga anime levels of simple the presentation is absolutely perfect the gameplay is very simple especially compared to later entries in the series which is to be expected and lot of the side content is flat out terrible xenoblade 1 feels like chance taken at experimenting that went extremely well,0
you haven played half life multiplayer means you ve never felt truly alive gauss is the best gun in videogames ever campaing is cool though gargantua gave me some nightmare in my childhood ,0
an interesting fps that started grand story valve was in the zone while making this and it shows,1
 played before 2023 n one of the most revolutionary games out there having the story interwoven with the gameplay was really new and the fact that it did it so well just really helps the shooting feels great with unique environment and loved running around the world fighting aliens and marines it is so so good everyone should play this game will say it is dated and the source version of this game is completely broken but this game is so fun only think the issue is the end game and xen which they admitted they didn have enough time to work on this that they wanted ,1
this was actually quite good just some part of playing it felt like chore but once was into it was in ,1
the plot is the typical marvel plot it means it not my cup of tea the combat is little boring sometimes there are only one good boss and 3 bosses in all like 20 25 hours game don know what to say about this game m not sure why hoped it will be next da probably because of game journalists good optimisation the spaceship crashing into planet game sequence was made by literally brainless person solid 5 5 10 game tho ,0
 played before 2023 n this game is super underrated amazing levels dialogue music and graphics with lot of interesting choices that change little things but still is fun to enjoy calling your buddies to do certain abilities in combat is so fun and makes you feel like the leader of team and the enemies are cool as well with lot of alien variety think the biggest issue is that it drags on bit longer than expected with some filler and you don get all your powers until the second to last planet another small issue had is your character itself isn too interesting the shooting from your guns feels pretty weak and there isn a lot of variety in your own movements or cool abilities like the ones your friends have but still great game that don hear enough about so d highly recommend it ,1
the story was fine characters were fun mysteries meh and the game mechanics drove me nuts ,1
the fact this is comfort game to me purely because know exactly what im getting into every time watch it sickening,0
the game that got me into visual novels this is everything an escape room story should be and each each chapter leaves you trying to figure out the clues all by yourself each character whether they last or not is full of charm dedicated to their ultimate talents the payoff leaves you on edge but is worth every moment just don ,1

detested daily life as in my opinion it was too long even though relevant to character development it could have been either shorter or more entertaining whereas deadly life kept me invested and,0
ouldn stop playing however ended up abandoning the game as i,1
h any more of the daily life ,0
it is good game but who wants too much doesn catch anything ,1
starts off strong but kinda falls at the end if you are looking for story don bother ,0
really cool concept hampered by some clunky combat and being bit light on the story ,0
i fucking love this game only don like that you need 20 members to fight the final boss other then that it nearly perfect you have slu of weapons to use that can be useful in there own way and can be someones favorite as well as the curses you can use that can give you secondary effects the art direction is one of the best things about it and having to manage all of your members with their sleeping arangements dieseases faith etc gave it bit of persona animal crossing feel to it easily one of the best games of last year ,1
the roguelite and management sim stuff is simple and shallow compared to other games that do it better but its great introduction to the genre visuals and music are amazing too ,1
the best sonic game,1
pretty good glad sega decided to go back to sonics roots ,1
pretty good,1
incredible game love letter to classic sonic titles and platformers of the past and one of the best 2d platformers in general ,1
i unintentionally played on encore mode my first time which really should not have the visuals and music are consistently great the controls feel like they should and the level design is about right for what the devs were going for it a good game just had bad first impression which won quite go away ,1
fans do what sega don pretty much the best return to form of the classic sonic series we have seen yet as this by far exceeds what the handheld sonic games tried to do in regards to keeping 2d sonic alive the soundtrack is bangin the level design is bangin the game is chock full of references to previous sonic games this is truly sonic fan sonic game play it dangit,1
a mecânica do arco ser arma principal a lança secundária me atraiu bastante junto das estrategias diferentes para cara maquina história é ok mundo é bem bonito mas game não incentiva tanto explorar mesmo sem tantas coisas loot ao redor do mapa por exemplo ,0
 played before 2023 n big fan of this game it is really unique idea of robotic dinosaurs combined with lush vibrant post apocalyptic world the soundtrack is really good and enjoyed the characters quite bit even if they could feel quite dimensional you don really get that many rpg elements so you can really focus or build on specific aspects but it reminds me of more streamlined monster hunter when combating robots using only slings and arrows think the game definitely was missing lot of aspects that are commonplace in the genre but this was their first open world game there were frustrating moments and lot of the times enemies move too quickly even during slow mo to let you take advantage of shooting weak points and think the melee combat is pretty terrible light and heavy sweep that is pretty much it the platforming is really good but also got annoying to traverse sometimes epseically with how many mountain areas there are d recommend it though for first attempt they did great job ,0
i am madly in love with ellis,0
this game is just perfectly crafted for what it trying to achieve challenging exciting satisfying and endlessly replayable ,1
plays like physical arcade game pure mechanics extra stars for doing dlc right ,1
shrek gordon ramsey homer and the rest of the cast really make the game they need to make defibs more obvious tho ,0
 played before 2023 n it is left 4 dead 2 some of the best horde shooting out there great levels and characters and the fact that it is so moddable with such high quality content can give you hundreds upon hundreds of hours to enjoy this masterpiece plus you basically get left 4 dead 1 for free so you pretty much get two games for one ,1

i was really not familiar with scp backrooms or any other creepypastas really so this kind of world was totally new to me and loved it tons of ideas and unique sequences really like how common objects can have their own semblance of personnality and be terrifying gameplay is fun enough and noticed some interesting themes near the end of the game ,0
was playing this purely for the alan wake link but think it too weird for its own good control thinks it being david lynch but it actually more david lunch ,1
natsuki is the best one cute game aside from the fact that it actually not cute at all and lied,1
you need to experience this game with the right context for it to truly hit that context being knowing nothing about this game and playing it because you enjoy visual novels ,1
my 2nd most embarassing playtime,0
my mom never let me play video games during the week so as kid coming home from school on friday was big deal really never saved my money for video games at the time so essentially played this game for 2 years constantly the free roaming is great the story is engaging and experimental even though there are issues with bugs it still is an incredible game that think everybody should play ,0

ive played this game like 20 times,1
the combat in this game is insane the open world is enjoyable overall story is pretty good game makes you say ,1
this game is really good game in it own right however there are some mechanics that prefer in yakuza zero still great time however ,1
thought should give the series chance after hearing nothing but praise for these games over the last few years understand why so many people love them but yeah not for me the weirdness is not my kind of weird and the seriousness isn my kind of serious don love combo based combat kind of hate non expressive roleplaying rpg mechanics and the length of put down the controller cutscenes just kind of had me at an arm length maybe it great later on but know what isn gonna go down smooth these days ,0

10 years in the joint made you fucking pussy,0
this is an 8 but like being dad ,1
a lot of really good setpiece moments but on the whole this game is kind of mess in most departments the faults aren enough to be deal breaker and there some real all timer moments here and there but this game is nightmare in terms of pacing it still fun to play gun guys are there though so it isn the most fun to play at points but sometimes it can feel bit clunky against the faster enemies and bosses even in the fastest fighting style majima everywhere can just go to hell too ,0
truly one of the greatest visual novels ever released if not the best it has memorable lively unique and lovable cast of characters though miles edgeworth is obviously the one who shines the most which is not something we usually encounter in visual novel the cases gradually got better and better and the last case was literal masterpiece the fourth case was my favorite though since the character development in this is just so heartwarming the dialogue in this game never ever bored me did not skip one dialogue in this game and this is the first time this happened to me in visual novel everything is just so well written the story is always exciting and makes you curious about what will happen in the next testimony and you also always wonder how the things will turn out while investigating the soundtrack and the character sprites are also very well done and both of these play big role in this game charm n to summarize all of the written above phoenix wright ace attorney has the most fun you can have in visual novel and is overall phenomenal video game ,1
a great start to the legendary lawyer ,1
edgeworth love you please be real,1
 objection ,0
vi anime uma vez pretendo jogar,0
basically impossible to enjoy if you haven already been playing it for like decade,1
it would take so little effort to make this playable game in casual but until then will just keep lamenting all the meme servers disappearing,0
funny n bots are annoying tho,0
i have wasted so much money on this game it shameful,0
game is good but not as good as first ,1
bad game fanservice and british people this game blows ,0
really good game had it fair share of awkward anime moments overall but really hit close to home at some point and had very lovable characters the zekenator babyyy,1
after being skeptical for year after it was announced because of the game taking place in rough post apocalypse desert trope love splatoon 2 for avoiding despite it post apocalypse setting eventually came around as the release date came closer and more promising things were revealed this turned out pretty good more splatoon with more stuff but unfortunately doesn reach any of 2 heights except for some of the new gameplay tweaks playing friends is better than ever but d rather go back to 2 in every other regards,0
yet to be bad splatoon game,0
campaign wasn as good as octo expansion 3 felt like mix of the splat 2 campaign and octo n still yet to beat the after alternae the final level cause it made me too mad lmao n online is cool as well though fell out of playing it 33,0
get this shit off my screen m trying to browse my backloggd,0
classic,1
 played before 2023 n mean it is silly little infinte game that you play when your internet is down and there is literally nothing to do you jump over things until you hit something night and day shifts are cool for browser game but nothing really interesting and think acting like this is anything better than something to play for five minutes while your router is restarting is kinda silly ,1
um dos jogos mais classicos da internet ele tem muito mas da pro gasto quando estamos sem internet é de longe melhor dos navegadores na minha opiniao sei tem outros ,1
it fairly good combat is crunchy if not perfectly controllable plot interesting even if the dialogue can get bit too dense sometimes music is good even if it hard to appreciate in context it just bit short the ending is bit abrupt although not entirely unsatisfying and the game doesn get enough time to really flesh out the mechanics so getting the rest out of your purchase is left to the speedrun mode which suffers from some of the less pleasant bits club stealth section straight from hell it not bad enough to leave you wanting though m not big on the slow motion mechanic either the slow mo is too extreme to be fun to use in combat and the systems are usually more fun to engage with in real time ,0
pure perfection personally need to go back to this game and 100 it before the dlc comes out if it ever will ,1
short and sweet beat it in one sitting love it,1
how the fuck do even explain in this shit is just that good,0
don t really know what this was but it was cool,1
waiting with great excitement on that dlc sequel ye,1
a beautiful story that think is one of the best games in the choose your own adventure genre of video games even if your choices along the way don ,1
ust change the,0
on love the en,1
rd n n disclaimer these are my brief tho,0
i hate this star wars prequel esque rewriting of history about ds2 it still very obviously the worst in the series,0
the complete 180 this game took in comparison to its predecessor in every way is kind of fuckin appaling the interconnectedness and metroidvania ness of the level design is gone in its stead the entire world is several long linear corridors one after another n aesthetically it everything liked the least about ds1 dialed up to 100 and all the cooler stuff removed n gameplaywise it feels so much more floaty so much more uncomfortable so much worse can even explain it quite well the whole entire atmosphere the game gives me sort of makes everything just feel so much more ugly and shitty ,0
light sick substantially worse than the first but still more quality to be had than imitators and other big budget games of its era ve found that infusing my weapons has turned my good damage to trash so m currently farming to undo that ,0
that the harshest score ve given souls game wouldn have made it through without friends to keep my sanity at bay ,0
replaying this game and beating every boss except the ancient dragon and vendrick both of which aren fights they are just gigantic health bars with legs in under week made me realize that not only am a fucking freak of nature with no time management but that this game is in weird middle ground where everyone opinion on it is simultaneously wrong and right ,0
arkane oyunlarına alışamadım,0
deathloop in concept is cool but when executed these ideas don particularly mesh well and make good game ,1
fun but doesn help that colt isn that interesting and the ending felt deflated ,0
maybe ll come back to it later enjoyed some of it but it has some level design issues and just feels bland also don like how areas feel to distant ,0
dishonored but kinda not great annoying dialogue plays like bioshock 1 but released in 2021 ,1
i like how you have to figure out some sort of mechanic for each boss it ,1
d love the fact that you re fighti,1
and it a lot more entertaining than just dodge block attack heal ,1
a game well ahead of its time which means it not very pleasant to play on an original ps2 anymore the remake for ps4 ps5 is the definitive way to experience shadow of the colossus but it might be worth playing the original version just to be impressed by what the game managed to do for its time ,1
que jogo gostoso da porra mlk pensar que um jogo de matar colosso poderia ser absurdo uma mas delicia que os outros tirando os quadrupedes alguns são meme menos que você derruba as colunas aquele sim é maneiro n como eu queria ter sido mais inteligente quando menor teria jogado isso antes n ps2 em 2005 sofria firme em ,0
o mundo vazio cinza entre os colossos definitivamente não é pra todo mundo mas viajar por esses terrenos mortos só adicionou experiência melancólica do jogo pra mim os colossos são uma aula de boss fight level design música design é impressionante como eles transformam um só bicho numa fase completa ,0
good game but it has an empty and boring world not such good story but you may enjoy some boss battles n 5 8,1
played this game fully with friend on hard mode and it was blast ,0
cowabunga bitches,0
rating 7 8 10 pretty good,1
played through this twice now once with my friend and once on my own good game was never much of tmnt fan at all but have just never had the time to really get into it the era of ninja turtles that most intrest me like im sure many is the 80s cartoon era this game is really cool time capsule of not only by playing into the iconic gameplay style of the time the konami ninja turtle arcade games but it perseveres most of the original voice actors art style referances and characters the game almost can feel like crash course to somebody like me who doesnt know much about the series which really apreciate there are some really good tracks in this most of which were composed by the sonic mania composer the physical edition even came with pizza hut coupon for free personal pan pizza which is incredible ate pizza pretty much every time played this game this game is very worthy of sitting next to scott pilgrim as dotemu classics looking forward to the next beat em up game in this style that they adapted next ,1
when first played this game had so much confidence thinking could play this in one sitting but ve been humbled one of the most interesting games ve completed as whole and wish can experience it blind again ,1
the music could be better,1
na superfície sifu apresenta modernização total levada as últimas consequências até então do estilo beat em up um jogo de luta divido em 5 fases que propõe vários inimigos chefes diferentes distribuídos entre elas para serem derrotados com diferencial de que jogador possui um talismã mágico que revive sempre que sofre uma lesão fatal em combate com desvantagem de que ele envelhece um número de anos com cada ressurreição acabará morrendo quando magia do talismã for usada em uma idade avançada ,0
 played before 2023 n excellent combat like really really excellent absolutely love it but that is pretty much the game it is kung fu scene not kung fu movie the levels look beautiful but you are doing the same gameplay loop in every single one with different background but it is still great even with that and really rewards you for getting good at the game ,1
i wish was better at this game ,1
i remembered beat it with warps,0
literal pegar tudo que deu certo melhorar ainda mais adicionar mais coisas novas tão incríveis quanto fez desse melhor mario 2d até agora pra mim fiz 100 amei ,0
an absolute classic and one of the all time best if not the all time best mario platformers ,1
it shocking how the mainline mario series trailblazed so hard for the platformer genre and games as whole in just its first few entries the level themes may seem standard now but it important that this was the n first n major game to do the whole grass desert water snow lava etc thing honestly contender for best nes game period and absolutely holds up the most n my only complaint is that upon replay the levels were lot shorter than remembered and wish some of the really cool power ups hammer suit weren so hidden ,0
the best part of smb3 is throwing hammer at boom boom and having it make million damage noises as it hits him making it sound like you ve harmed him so badly that you ve retroactively deleted his entire lineage from history ,0
this game is excellent suck at it but it so much fun assassin creed wishes it could do this ,0
dishonored n is one of the few games ,1
kojima você é um gênio n joguei dessa vez termino jogo mais tristonho do que antes ficou óbvio que se the boss não quisesse morrer snake nunca teria chance contra ela no mano mano que não existe lado certo no jogo que não somos os mocinhos que the boss assim como snake foi usada pelo seu próprio país ela não se sacrificou por algo benevolente mas sim foi usada de válvula de escape pra dissuasão continuar entre as potências dissuasão essa que em primeiro lugar nem mesmo deveria existir n she was true patriot n ela se doou de corpo alma pelo seu país mesmo com essa causa sendo imoral suja ela não fez isso cegamente ela mesma tem consciência na instabilidade do mundo que não existem heróis nem vilões nele nome dela vai carregar todo ódio infâmia dessa geração das próximas ela morreu mais de uma vez pelo seu país ninguém nunca vai saber disso ela tinha consciência de tudo isso n se isso não é ser patriota eu não sei que é n mas questionamento é valeu pena ,0
matei velho mudando data do console n mt pika,0
unique gameplay encounters and cool setting make this one of the better mgs titles in the series what thrill ,1
absolutely incredible every aspect of this game is incredible it takes itself serious enough to make good storyline and yet doesn take it self serious at all you can throw grenade into gator mouth and it will explode like cartoon the music is incredible the graphics hold up the r1 gimmic durring cutscenes can give you better feeling for snake can be hilarious or anything else every boss is incredible and unique the camoflage gimmick is very fun to mess around with and all the different ways you can play this games makes an easy 10 10 masterpiece on all fronts ,1
i swear kojima is actually psychic,1
very nice interactive movie drags little for what it is near the end ,0

journey is memorable experience while short making your way through world finding help along the way and eventually feeling more free than ever it a very charming game ,0
an excellent time the story is amazing the worlds are fantastic to go through and the feeling of growth is fantastic having the perfect pace imo 100 completion of this game is this experience honestly shines ultima weapon being highlight for me ,1
i don understand why this game exists but the ost slaps and cloud is in it so it good,0
h it confusing but this is the most grounded it ll get watching cloud strife interact with donald duck is insane enough this game has some goofy stuff but think it part of the charm the gameplay is pretty fun and while later entries improve 3d rpg combat is satisfying the story takes nice turn on the chosen one trope and while there are plenty of cliches and broken lines they re still kids cringe pra kct gaming tbh played playstation 4 final mix version was pleasantly surprised that this has not aged as badly the gameplay isn as smooth as some of the later entries but it still solid unlike some of the other games this has relativity simple story that help eases new people to the series n good game that does not need remake ,0
it a short game and all but had fun ,1
one of the most refreshing shooter campaigns ve played in long time and it 7 years old ,1
it wants to be half life 3 so bad,0
flawless movement and gunplay ,0
i revisited titanfall 2 years after playing it first on console and honestly had blast second time the solo campaign is probably one of my favorite of any modern fps games solid gameplay ,1
recomendadisimo,1
classic,1
doom my beloved,1
 played before 2023 n it is doom it is fun and revolutionized the world bringing fps to the forefront of our culture but it hasn aged that well the level design is complicated but horrible where everything is maze half the time you ll be running around an empty level looking for that one door that gives you yellow keycard with nothing in it and the music is more like butchered versions of famous metal songs the guns are great and the enemy design is rich and unique but really felt like they weren used to their full capability monster closets come from this game and really just aren interesting way to introduce majority of the enemies still pretty important to play and experience culture but definitely don think it has aged well ,1
esta god es medio viejo pero se sigue jugando bastante bien yo me lo termine papito jugo al doom ,0
a really solid anthology of mini gold era square rpgs lost to time now easily accessible via this hd2d remake live live is must play for anyone who enjoys square super nintendo output or anyone who wants jrpg that doesn play by the book ,1
this is collection of bunch of vignettes that all play with jrpg tropes in unique ways and for the most part found these stories really unique and entertaining this feels like the predecessor to chrono trigger in many ways so fans of that game will immediately see similarities it mostly very accessible game but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with certain chapters enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game but are particularly unconventional and could make for very weak first impression aside from that tho honestly loved this combat is big standout for me each encounter was like mini tactics battle with really fun grid system had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively and while it far from difficult game each battle had me engaged presentation is gorgeous with the hd 2d switch remake it a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original while some chapters are definitely weaker than others thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game and while won spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience this definitely deserves to be considered classic of the era right alongside ffvi and chrono trigger ,1
such creative and imaginative rpg from start to finish that d honestly place it among my favorites the amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at the battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people it was bit of blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all ,1
honestly there just wasn enough here to keep me engaged most of the chapters don encourage exploration the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact the space episode was the best one that got to and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points expect more from rpg even remasters of old classics if the combat is boring the story had better be engaging if the story is underwhelming want to be excited for each battle neither of these is the case for this game it truly overstayed its welcome ,1
the best soundtrack ve ever heard in video game ,1
played the game after watching the tv show which was probably not in favor of the game loved the show better but here loved how the gameplay was set up and lot more zombies than the show so it was fun very solid game ,1
gameplay intertwines with the narrative so perfectly simple game mechanically but so much greater than the sum of its parts beautiful story of quality that has seldom graced the gaming landscape true modern classic ,1
spectacular through and through,0
hbo did it better tbh,1
i loved this game joel and ellie relationship building throughout the game is so wonderful to see the world they build in this game is also so wonderful from the body horror of the infected to tommy town this game is masterpiece ,1
recomendado pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega no lo tenian todo atado,1
lixo jogo desgraçado n level design pavoroso dps da green hill zone n detestei foi uma das experiencias que mais me irritou nessa franquia inteira olha que eu joguei sonic 2006 ,0
a masterpiece of design more than it is an actually great game at the same time if you re competing with mario being able to have style and sound profile that burns itself into young mind is the only way to gain ground since it gonna be really hard to make up that distance mechanically ,0
fun if you re good and not alone ,1
well after 3k hours played must confess that m very addicted to this game but no matter what ll never learn how to play it on the controller ,0
the idea of the game good indeed but it may only be fun when you play with another player in local multiplayer n 7,1
has problems but still like it lot ,0
great ui beautiful graphics high quality voice acting that the franchise is known for and the biggest world map with incredible attention to detail condensed with so much batman history that it feels like the most complete love letter to the batman mythos yet an interesting reimagining of one of batman well known stories ,1
this makes you feel like batman,1
this game is too much of everything for its own good do not recommend it ,1
combat still fun but definitely less fun than 2 despite added complexity worth full playthrough if you like the series but the story falls short,0
kinda hated every new gimmick added to the formula none of it is nearly as good as the core combat with bayonetta ,0
in post elden ring post sekiro and hell even post devil may cry 5 world its hard to look at this game and really look forward to anything platinum games puts out next this was the one where they werent working for anybody but themselves ,0
bayonetta 3 ends up not only the worst but the most disappointing entry in the series ,0
the weakest bayonetta in the series the game feels like they mad half of it played dmc 5 and then tried really hard to force in similar passing the torch story without the same setup dmc had viola feels like joke character for the entire game and the ending fell very flat for me ,0
i really enjoyed this one the story is super interesting most characters are multi layered and more complex than they initially seem and how this game handles skills and thoughts is genius as most reviews for this game have said it really great that failing skill check does not necessarily mean you re now going through worse version of the game in some cases it even more fun route the politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media personally found myself more engrossed by the game study of the main character who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing huge amount of his character to be determined by the player normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character but this mixture of both helps lot in giving the player much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story n on that note the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane and they really don feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character once again this contributes heavily into making the player fit into the role playing aspect of this game more as their choices contribute to the type of cop they want to be ,0
there is too much you could say about this game less of game more of an interactive story with rpg elements and the story is amazing ,1
some of the most human feeling characters in games it well written well acted and generally very good well worth playthrough if it looks at all interesting ,1
i really loved this game and how it able to make you feel like harry through his inner voices the art style it so iconic and the music is so good can forget them little bit short but really worth it and you can replay it several times,1
i too stupid to get the most out of this game but absolutely appreciated how they personified the emotions traits and presented the rpg mechanic in such visual and eclectic way ,0
the song is called smell of the game because people who play this shit reek,0
if hear one more of you goofy motherfuckers say brisket or balling one more time am going to burst vein,0
scum dipper ,0
getting my shit kicked in rn but this is as fun as expected n amazing graphics really well thought out mechanics that will take me while to master banger soundtrack great characters and top tier visual presentation n cons the lobby system sucks ass and the season passes are so pricey imo ,0
the perfect arcade game another type of game they ll never make again ,1
i used to work in nursing home that had wii bowling league and team of 5 ladies who we actually recorded and submitted to national tournament n so shout out to dot and her perfect game and to the wonderful team in 2013 you all did great ,1
best game ever really love it slay,1
one of the best party games and solid single player game,1
enjoyed this one lot as big harry potter fan the developers have done an incredible job in making hogwarts make sense and feel lived in at the same time love all the elements of lore hinting back to parts of the books whilst still feeling new some of the characters were very likeable and liked the three main subplots the main story was decent too with some dramatic and emotional moments combat is lot of fun too and flying is an awesome mechanic ,1
had lot of fun playing this ngl running around hogwarts was dream come true sadly has pretty weak ending and some rough edges but enjoyed almost the entire experience and will play again at some point,0
weirdest game ve played in awhile where at first was thinking it was possible goty then actually digging into the game you saw them just repeat everything ton of times over and over n what mindless slog,0
an incredible entry to the harry potter world it such refreshing game an interesting story would rather have bully esque focusing more on being student but still it a nice game ,1
such mess finished it just because don like to leave stuff halfway through can see all the money they had put into this game and the designers and 3d modelers hard work but it simply does not pay off this is just bunch of nice assets awkwardly put together the fighting system works and seems interesting at the beginning but by the end it is barely enjoyable spamming skills and rolling around from hundreds of enemies to what to get new pair of the same looking rounded glasses no no no we still do not get that this is harry potter inspired game 33 copies of the same old black cloak same thing with exploring there simply no reason to explore the giant territory of non interesting copy paste bandit and goblin camps stupid forest that spread across the highlands that looks exactly the same at any point of your destination apart from the small part to the south to get bunch of decorative pieces to be honest could go on and brag about every aspect of it from the upgrade system and the way you progress through it to the story arghhhh but this game does not deserve any kind of critique written toward it ,0
completed to fulfill childhood dream and it genuinely fun racing grand prix mode can be infuriating if you re trying to get star ratings though,1
the worst mario kart the sort of thing reprobate would come up with for fun motion controls can die ,0
skill issue,0
it the wii one everyone played this one it a fun mario kart don really like the motion controls but it does have funky kong funky music too ,1
i used to deeply dislike mario kart wii the controls felt unresponsive and wrong and the item balancing seemed nonexistent to me ,0
the worst of the modern re games but still fun ,1
got soft locked and do not wish to continue the game this game is bad man compared to re2 remake the level design is so bare bones the main threat nemesis only chases you in the first 30 minutes of the game and thats it the new dodge mechanic is janky and half baked idk it ,0
ust bad go play the original not this great game too short and the audio is kinda fucked up but other than that the game is amazing looks really bad compared to re2 harcamışlar oyunu ,0
unpacking is great game in bursts that is really amazing showcase of environmental story telling however this strength also becomes it weakness as it gets incredibly repetitive putting away the same objects in new obtuse locations,0
esse jogo é incrível para relaxar consegue trazer um sentimento de paz maravilhoso n por mais que simples ele é ótimo na sua proposta não tem pontos negativos que atrapalhem experiência n história por mais que simples consegue emocionar os jogadores mais atenciosos seus detalhes mensagens por trás ,0
i unpacked things it does the job well,1
foi pequeno demais mas gostei de fazer algo que não faço irl arrumar quarto,0
well this is not my piece of cake,1
i really enjoyed the gentle environmental storytelling here so many details that can be inferred from what items stick around between moves and which ones fall behind which in turn informs how you choose to sort and decorate these rooms making the practical layout line up as best as possible with your understanding of the protagonist and how they use the space there some really lovely stuff here about how as we grow we both keep some parts of ourself whilst shedding others and how moving home can be moment that brings these changes into focus ,0
good one,1

my parents were oddly strict about me getting gtaiv so while was waiting for my first proper gta experience managed to wrangle them into line just in time for red dead release ,0
as long time tales fan had high hopes for this game and must say that while there are good highs to the experience such as the combat there are also awful lows the 3rd act of the game the result is slightly above average game if you re here for the combat you ll have fantastic time even though it can get repetitive at times it flashy fluid and the best the series has ever been this is only made better by the fantastic soundtrack honestly did not mind listening to the same battle tracks for the duration of my almost 60 hour journey it that good ,1
i want to start this by saying that really n desperately n wanted to like this game genuinely was so excited to start it as m quite fan of the series ,1
the ending wasðÿ ðÿ ,0
summary great gameplay god awful story it a nice enough game to play despite how dull the story and characters are up until it faceplants during the final act n beating things up is fun enough to where think most people forgave the flaws as cursory look at the reviews here seems to show but just can overlook all the issues it has ,0
gameplay is some of the best tales has seen so far however the story and characters turned me off more so than other tales games made it right to the n spoilers n false ending lost interest after ,0
good but chapter 2 is bettar ,1
pretty great,1
i went to play blind and surprised myself unique gameplay with striking and charismatic characters with great comedy scenes ,1
pretty damn good n pretty damn scary n hope my wife is okay,0

what blast to play m sure if played it 10 years ago when it came out would ve thought it was super cheesy quick time events crazy camera angles tumbling all over the place scripted falls fails but enjoyed it lot the story sucks but the controls combat were super fun it nice to come back to something that was soo cliche during the release it nostalgic ,0
pretty good gameplay and exploration but the story and some of the situations you get yourself in are so unbelievably cheesy that it could break the immersion,0
zerei 100 do modo história com 34 horas n é sim um bom jogo mas não passa disso,0
truly engaging story and atmosphere with decent combat and stealth mechanics and memorable yet predictable characters ,1
un more of the same che però riperfeziona quello che il predecessore ha cercato di fare in ambito gameplay livelli sono di gran lunga più divertenti i power up sfruttati meglio il completismo è di gran lunga meno tedioso in generale ho preferito di più tamosfera di questo capitolo ,0
it feels less like sequel and more like dlc to an already great game nonetheless galaxy 2 is pretty good just not as good as the og,1
just as good as the original and like the cloud power up hate the introduction to shadow mario tho ,0
its mario galaxy but more of it and this time with yoshi the hub world got downgrade this time but it more than makes up for it with the increase in difficulty as well as n the addition of yoshi one shotting the final world is one of the best experiences that 3d mario can provide ,0
donkey kong country 1 is good it not the best in the series but it really sets up the sequels to be amazing games ,1
once you look past the technological achievement you end up with fun little game that has ton of flaws but still has lot of charm ,1
a great platformer both to play and look at it shocking how such early 3d cgi holds up and it doesn feel like it should be possible but it totally does there is nice straight forwardness to this game level design where it doesn pull many punches but doesn pull cheap tricks either the factory and jungle levels are cool minecart levels can be bit too strict the boss fights are generally uninspired and the low part of the game but the final boss is great the music is awesome too ,1
this is the first game played on my ps5 and really liked it lot it a pretty creative visual novel with great directing and inventive stories it not the most complex game out there but totally recommend it ,1
what remained was bunch of melancholic stories about the finch family ,1
it was good game wanted to play short game and this was only around 3 hours long think the story was melancholic and surprisingly good ,1
i ve been playing this series on and off since the original ps2 demo that came with devil may cry 3 without the online component available here in europe it was kinda ok but forgettable playing it solo moving onto the psp releases of freedom freedom 2 and unite where my friends and would all get together to play it wireless on our psps was an absolute blast and ve been huge fan ever since ,1
fun but too much it a miracle how this runs on switch ,1
my favorite fifth gen game worth every cent the wirebug system makes for speedy and interesting battles against the familiar and new monsters do miss the old mounting system that doesn detract enough from my enjoyment to lower the score though ,1

i felt like neo twewy desperately wants to get out of its own way and be its own game but it simply can pull it off n nearly everything in the game is reference to its predecessor ,0
this game is so awesome passion project for sure so much detail and effort poured into every crevice of this game it absurd not perfect but enjoyed it so much it deserves 10 gameplay is such huge improvement over the last game to me actually enjoyed the combat in this game all the characters have my heart esp rindo fret and shoka please play this ,1
it a great sequel did whole writeup where expressed my feelings broadly but also liked played this game ,1

ately the ways this game is mediocre do,0
t taint the first game the spirit shines through it just falls apart in execution with clunky pacing make dumb decisions so you can revisit them later painful combat my rsi my different flavor of pin evolutions tin pin slammer and technical issues all over the map is cancel is accept serious lag issues n at least we got high quality soundtrack this time the music still rules ,0
i didn think d like it as much as did ngl,1
o salto de evolução entre assassin creed 1 são é sobre um gigantesco abismo finalmente temos um bom sistema de escalada apesar de ele ser pouco polido às vezes temls um combate interessante apesar de também ter suas limitações no geral stelth existe para evitar um combate pouco inventivo onde você pode optar por um counter hitkill com as hiden blades esquivar torcer para acertar hitkill ou pode passar 10 minutos batendo contra arma do inimigo não tenho nostalgia com este jogo então reconheço suas qualidades evoluções mas também suas limitações n não há muito que fazer no mundo aberto combate fica cansativo o stelth pouco se faz importante usado em missões bem repetirivas 90 das vezes matar um inimigo na beira de um telhado fará ele cair 60 das vezes você cai junto se atacar correndo não é um grande problemão mas me chateia bastante principalmente porque geralmente você ataca correndo ,0
i was blown away by the improvements made in assassin creed ii the game graphics were stunning and the new setting of renaissance era italy was beautifully recreated the gameplay was smoother than its predecessor with more intuitive control scheme that made free running and combat more satisfying also appreciated the addition of wide variety of weapons and upgrades allowing for more personalized gameplay ,1
don wanna debate these games sorry matthew ,0
a sequel which just blew everyone expectations out the water don think ve ever been as engaged with setting and protagonist as have with italy and ezio ,0
i remember liking this less than 1,1
this is game can see why people like it but see so may problems with this one let me talk positive first the story in this game is really intrging with arven and team star and while not the best pokemon soundtrack it has it bangers like every team star theme now onto the negatives the game is not well optimized for the switch at all we have so many problmes both old and new as well as it overheating my switch recently the gym test and raiding team bases are boring and monotonous the titan bosses are joke with them being piss easy like the idea of an open world pokemon game but this game isn that at all there is an order to do things and even then you have to defeat team star bases to traverse further in the region the final battle is scrippted and don want that in pokemon game can understand why people like this game and think it better then sword and shield but this is not huge step up from those games ,0
la puntuación viene por el rendimiento técnico del juego que parece yo jugando un partido de futbol 7 en mitad de agosto,0
i ve never had such fun with pokemon game in long time thoroughly enjoyed the exploration and trying to catch them all aspects of the game the storylines were fun in their own rights as well victory road is exactly what it is and there nothing wrong with that starfall street dragged on but appreciated the themes and backstory of team star they have the best battle osts in the game short of the actual final boss and path of legends was very sweet and relatable it made me like arvan which is impressive after his introduction in the game could even go back to it and still enjoy it its that good for all its faults if you enjoy pokemon at all you don want to miss out on this one,1
reak has made the worst one ever four times in row now closest ive ever been to completing pokedex 2 3 starters suck and while it is open world there is very strict level for each area so you still have to figure out the right progression path on your own crashes lot but it has pikachu so its okey,0

when the space is dead,0
one of the best sci fi horror shooters ever made no wonder there was remake ,1
 played before 2023 n really good game but the remake just points out the flaws few things feel dated especially with some levels and character choices but the gameplay is still amazing it took what re4 did and created something unique and created unique environment the influences of event horizon and alien are obvious and it kickstarted well beloved franchise but honestly there is no reason to play this game just play the remake unless you really need more dead space and you want to see the slight changes ,1
fun game with fun power ups just wish these new super mario bros games used different sounds from game to game this one feels lot different than the wii one as far as the levels go but it sounds exactly the same so it tricks my brain into it feeling even less standout than it already is this scratched my mario itch though so good job guys who made this ,0
laughed til cried griefing my friends both accidentally and intentionally please play with friends it so much better,0
can say remember too much about this one but it started war and now we will never get another 2d mario game again thanks nintendo ,1
it still not mind blowing but it kinda insane how much of glowup this is compared to what we got in the good old days and how well it still holds up in general,1
 played before 2023 n this game is definitely amazing it might be lacking in lot of aspects but that is on purpose with some of the best scaled boss fights around this was 1 1 graphical update of the game and nothing else something wish more remakes did everyone should play this game ,1
the intentionally empty open world creates an atmosphere unmatched in any game this is the first strand like game the lack of dopamine drip collectables makes it so the player can focus on appreciating the world for what it is instead of having to focus on picking up all the garbage on the ground to level up your fart cannon 0 5 more damage ,0

rip lance,0
 played before 2023 n every single issue had with the original game is fantastic and wonderful love it the gameplay is better the soundtrack is better the story is better and the graphics are better everything about this game is amazing and loved the 80 hours had in it the enemies are super cool and unique you get way more control of build and what you want to focus on the world is much more fleshed out with unique areas and overall think this is one of the best games out there ,1
as god of war game it incredible n that one the first gow that played and have lot of emotions for that game it pretty simple the story and the gameplay but you will like it it a historical game n 8 7,1
 played before 2023 n god don get the absolute love for this game the combat is fun but jesus christ every enemy in the world takes billion hits and it gets so boring with every enemy feeling like bullet sponge love the fighting and the character brutality but the level design is trash the puzzling is awkward and annoying you barely explore the city and spend most of your time in one area and ares looks really silly the powers you get are cool for the most part but there isn much else that is enjoyable about this game outside of the character you play and some of the soundtrack oh and the alternate costumes the alternate costumes are great ,0
un juego entretenido con una historia muy simple denota inspiración en la saga devil may cry pero con el añadido de la historia griega me parece un título promedio con momentos memorables como el los dioses del olimpo me han abandonado la ascensión de kratos al trono de ares pero como he dicho es una historia simple que no viene tener grandes conflictos internos de personajes externos de la obra en cuanto jugabilidad me parece extremadamente sencilla repetitiva pero para un solo título está bien para dos ya no ,0
this game in the moment is really fun with fun combat and everything being responsive the bosses being fun the specticel is on point and the music is great but can say this is great game since it has some design decisions that are little shit every rope and climbing section is bad there were only 3 boss fights which was kinda dissapointing the path of hades will never like there was only 2 magic spells you really needed posidens wrath and army of hades since they do so much damage and are aoe attacks zues lightning and medusa are situational imo and the game isn as mechanically in depth as something like dmc bayonetta or ninja gaiden still was good game hope 2 is better ,1

um jogo que medíocremente tenta propiciar novidades quanto fórmula de um jogo de persona tanto em aspectos de sua gameplay como na limitação da história para um curto período de tempo que fracassa em todos os aspectos simultaneamente gerando ao máximo uma experiência mediana ,0
tbh found this game to be long and tedious the story was forgettable and thought the gameplay was okay but not really the best just found it pretty boring half of the time in all honesty don understand why they would even make this game 1 point cause of how cool some of the character designs were ,1
the closest warriors game gets to being interesting but unfortunately this still suffers from the same fate other warriors games do the gameplay gets too repetitive and is not interesting enough to not get stale by the end of the game still merging the persona skill system with this style was pretty well done so it gets points there and the story is alright its about what you expect for spinoff title certainly not as good as mainline persona stories but okay for what it is the new characters are quite nice especially zenkichi basically its okay but only just okay soundtrack is hard naturally last surprise strikers is even better than base last surprise ,0
has nothing on playdead other game inside but fun couple hours through an amazingly atmospheric game the no point in dying achievement was also great challenge that made the game so much more stressful ,0

this was my childhood pokemon game and if you know what people on the internet say that means then this should be my favorite out of the bunch logged like 300 or so hours in this as kid just vibing and nowadays barely play the series while exploring the world and looking at the pokemon was fun for me never really got into the whole gameplay loop that much if didn get this game around the same time as toys us event giving out free level 100 regigigas to players probably wouldn have actually finished this as just had that mfer carry me all the way to the end it was still fun as kid to be into the pokemon series as through playing this with friends and trading pokemon messing around with their action replay to get hacked pokemon have fond memories playing this even if was bullied in school for carrying phonebook sized strategy guide for this game around with me it just that ve realized over time that just don like main series pokemon games so this game has become inherently less special over time ,0
well that story just goes off the rails in the best possible way didn really dig the combat maybe m wimp but it was too tough for me so bumped it down to easy and then it was fine just don care for combat that is that unforgiving my time is worth more that that n after that though had great time its not really final fantasy game except in name and in story this is spoiler free review but man it be fun to spoil it check it out and if you don hate the combat stick with it it feels rewarding just wish the combat felt as good as the rest of it ,0
it been year since this game released and still regularly think about it not to mention occasionally booting it back up to play few missions when m not feeling anything else think it time to bump that score ,0
fun,1
this game is absolutely amazing n the gameplay is far different than anything from typical fps and absolutely loved it sure had to get used to it at first but the more understood of how it was meant to be played the more loved it love going around locations and solving puzzles the game is oozing with so much style it absolutely amazing n love the boss fights especially the fact that they re far from the typical boss fight but more thematic to the greater whole of killer7 is amazing and wish more games did something of similar effect n the story as well is one of if not the best part of the game it easily has some of the most thought provoking theme rich complex stories of any game that have played and love it even though think have good understanding of what this game themes are the fact that there still stuff that m trying to wrap my head around is magnificent and its rare for game to really do that n this game is without doubt absolutely amazing ve been meaning to play more of suda51 work as the only other game ve played of his is no more heroes 1 and this game has motivated me to get to the rest sooner ,1

who the fuck at rockstar thought mashing the x button to sprint would be good idea and why is that feature in all of their games ,1
this sets gold standard for remakes takes what improved from the sequel and adds it into the original while keeping the atomsphere and tension present from the original while at the same time also adding on whole new area and building upon the already pre established lore and characters to give them greater presence in the series as whole ,0
samus go brrrrr fun game,1
esse foi meu primeiro metroid me absorveu completamente pela jogabilidade ágil fluida num cenário que tempo todo me apresentava alguma coisinha nova sejam caminhos sejam power ups ,0
a masterpiece of gaming metroid zero missions takes the good parts of fusion and super and combines them into one delicious meal while also providing the best way to play the original metroid game,1
another timeless classic and masterpiece from the metroid series this game takes you on sightseeing tour of zebes and reimagines the world from the nes classic metroid games rarely miss and this is no exception the only issue have with this game is that its too short want more n best boss ridley n difficulty 3 5 n controls 5 5 n atmosphere 4 5 n length 3 5 n boss fights 4 5 n average 3 8 5,0
i love video games but m not particularly good at video games especially older ones that require you to wander around for hours exhausting every possibility imaginable ,0
my all time favourite game and unlikely to ever be topped story aeons characters turn based battle system sphere grid locations incredible sound tracks could go on loved this adventure as kid and love it even more all these years later ,1
bawled my eyes out,1
canción de la introducción suena n se le paran los pelos del culo,0
its cool,1
such sweet story managed to make me cry in the end,0
listen to my story more romantic take on ff in the new era with voice acting and animated expressions is warm welcome to the series the combat system is fast with switchable party members and viewable orders the story of tidus auron and yuna are beautiful to watch ,1
proibam kodaka de fazer jogos por amor de deus,0
most of the game felt like slightly better version of the first game with some lower lows than the first game but higher highs so both are almost equal for me but overall think this is slightly better than the first game ,1
peak peak peak this is the pinnacle of murder mystery stories holding nothing back from the first game the game actively tries to turn you around and lose your predictions highlights being trial 5 which wants you to lose all hope but through critical thinkinf it possible to get out this cast is the best in the series even characters that don last long are full of personality and it hard to pick out who might die next in comparison to the first game god love nagito ,0
danganronpa continua sendo uma das melhores peças de midia que eu já tive prazer de consumir tenho palavras pra descrever historia foda universo foda personagens fodas narrativas fodas menos capitulo 3 volto repetir eu fiquei anos com pé atrás pra jogar agora simplesmente consigo parar de consumir tudo que seja relacionado isso ,0
the highs in this are for sure higher then the first game but man the lows are also somehow even lower n at the end of the day still like it bit more but still ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ,1
awwww look the little black mage love black mages n this character lead to me almost crying in the finale ,0
this game starts off incredibly but kinda slowly tapers off as you near the finish line it hard not to love the entire cast but the villains are missing that little something imho the combat can be pretty painfully slow at times you re going to miss lot of really good items if you re not beating the game fast enough which on one hand is cool as fuck but on another is lame as hell for game that begs you to take your time and smell the roses and the final boss expects you to have put lot of work into your builds like making sure most status immunities are learned by whichever four characters you use as your main party after whole game of pretty easy combat encounters that don expect too much of you love this game and get why it some people favorite in the series but it just missing something in the end,0
worst combat in the series literally who thought automatic limit breaks would be good idea also lack of party customization which while it definitely saves time is also one of my favorite aspects of final fantasy so it is bit sad to not feature it here also extremely slow battles with camera panning taking forever and tetra master is just an awful minigame and the fact that you need to win multiple games of it at one point in the story is abysmal chocobo hot cold is also awful every minigame in this game is awful except the first one in the opening which you can never replay again ,0
masterpiece worth putting your time into,1
my favorite childhood game and favorite final fantasy overall love this game and have it on too many platforms ,1
and absolute gem and masterpiece my all time favorite jrpg this is definitely one of my comfort games from when was kid and still is many many years later ,1
esse ano eu tive prazer de terminar pela primeira vez na vida um jogo da franquia zelda outra da franquia metroid n o mais incrível é os 2 pertencem galeria de jogos do gba n eu gostei muito do metroid fusion tem uma gameplay bem legal soundtrack boa uma historia bacana sem contar tem uma atmosfera muito boa com sa sempre pelo mapa vc fica com medo de dar de cara com ela quando entra em alguma sala n cuidado com os ouvidos viu pq ridley nesse jogo vai te deixar surdo ,0
may be better than super ,1
it so incredibly linear it made me wonder why kept playing it it should have been an insta drop from the first hour ,1
i really enjoyed this game my relationship with the metroid series is one of admiration it not my favorite series but there lots that love about it fusion is very fun time lot of your metroid staples are more streamlined and made more linear you would think this would be bad thing but it was actually very refreshing exploration is key staple of the series and there is some of that here but sometimes in past games it feels too cryptic and unintuitive it easy to get stuck and don have time to waste now that m older lol the enemy design is great the graphics are crisp sound design is great soundtrack was nothing too amazing this game has some of the coolest designed bosses and some great fights it fun it not super long and the story is interesting really enjoyed it and think you will too super metroid is still my fav but man this was good,1
just finished fresh playthrough and dunno amazing linear game if you just get what you need and plow through the story but the me of today compared to when this came out can definitely see how it a bit naff as metroid experience the most limited title of them all save maybe metroid 2 which this calls back to lot funnily enough with what is normally joyous full powered clean up turned into pain in the arse slog n but just don play it like that treat it as not metroid and it great thumbs up ,0
esse é melhor final fantasy eu não estou aberto à discussões,0
one of best final fantasy ,1
why is 6 afraid of 7 seriously why ,0
this is the first final fantasy game could easily call masterpiece there are so many incredible moments combined with amazing music and visuals will forever love ffvi it means the world to me,1
one of my favorite visual novels ever beatable within like 4ish hours and yet up there with sn for me amazing game ,1
so many characters that would kill for them to just shut up complimentary ,1
esse jogo tem incontáveis qualidades diálogos super bem escritos uma arte trilha sonoras encantadores um estilo de visual novel bem peculiar revigorante eu amei muito bom mesmo ,0
the vibes here are exactly on point though will say it ended quite abruptly must have gotten bad ending or something making drinks and talking to people is fun vibe just randomly getting to know the people that come and go from the place while also keeping up with regulars though will say the dialog was like oddly horny if that makes any sense like lot of characters during small talk would just bring up some weird sexual thing which was lil weird for me personally but eh maybe that just how things be in that world the yiik stuff aged like sour cream in hot car still definitely worth playing for the vibes tho gotta love those vibes ,0
simplesmente um primor no mundo dos games ele conseguiu me apaixonar justamente num dos estilos que menos gosto 2d 8 bit eu simplesmente amo esse jogo gameplay art design soundtrack tudo principalmente suas musicas são definição de perfeição ,0
bizarre difficulty spikes but shit is gas,0
what an amazing rogue like,1
after this game ubisoft only made terrible stuff ,0
a primeira ótima tacada da franquia tão bom que seguinte é praticamente uma tentativa de copiar o depois desse teve que mudar praticamente tudo para não ser só mais uma sombra da tentativa de replicar sucesso n tem seus defeitos como geografia da ilha que às vezes é ruim de percorrer na vertical uma certa decepção nos confrontos contra os grandes vilões mas no geral é uma obra prima dentro do que ele faz muito divertido um ótimo fator replay um jogo que com certeza envelheceu como vinho até hoje ,0
sanırım bu oyundan daha farklı içerikler beklemek benim hatamdı ama kadar erteleme bana yeni şeyler sunar izlenimi vermişti ama maalesef ki öyle olmadı oyun ilk oyunun üzerine kadar az şey ekliyor ki insan öncekini oynadıysam bunu tekrardan neden oynadım ki diyor gerçekten benim için büyük hayal kırıklıklarından birisiydi ,0
never played the original or the 2013 standalone but have very quickly become obsessed super witty and engrossing and little anxiety inducing tons of fun especially with group of drunk friends ,0
i looked forward to every ending in this game its pure absurd meta narrative fun ,0
the stanley parable is one of the most unique games have ever played it so bizarre in its nature goofy yet serious to scary degree ,0
this was during the time where indie games were ruling my life,0
super n hot n super n hot,1
game 74 superhot,1
just not ton going on here an interesting gimmick done to death with nothing else involved ,0
a timeless classic replayable forever and ever ,1
i never let the zombies get to my house any time m about to lose restart just so don hear the brain munching because it terrifies me,0
seria mejor si pudiera fumarme las plantas,0
one of the most bizarre ports of game ve played crusty as hell but charming ,0
bring back that goat shit n plants vs zombies the og goat and goty ,0
a super solid and fun experience doesn fall flat in any areas gradually introduces new mechanics as you play which keeps it from getting stale and instills great sense of progression m pretty sure even my mom would like this game ,1
it a fun metroidvania it holds your hand bit and is fun to play while being very pretty game but it didn leave much of an impact on me ,1
esse jogo é exemplo de um jogo que se beneficiaria de mecânicas mais aprofundadas apesar de continuar sendo um jogo bom ,1
i would ve liked it but it basically requires walkthrough open at all times to progress and d rather not play the game at all than play it with walkthrough ,0
i hated this game the story was great the music was wonderful the art design was great but the gameplay was clunky and infuriating did finish it yes did wish hadn also yes ,1
so fucking pretty,0
world tendency gives me unneeded anxiety,0
not the best souls game but as the very first in the genre it pretty dang good short but good didn mind the healing system as much after getting past the tower knight don give up ,1
that last half star is cuz of the healing items,1
i expected so much of this but its not bad at all,0
antes da review vale ressaltar que peguei jogo gratuitamente na epic games n jogo excelente personagens muito bons uma história imersiva em 100 do tempo uma espécie de plot muito bom nos últimos 20 do jogo únicos defeitos que posso dizer aqui é ia burra a gameplay um pouco repetitiva pra um jogo com 16 horas pra zerar recomendo 100 ,1
bom mas repetitivo curti história ,0
too linear and repetitive for me but loved the vibe and atmosphere ,1
a plague tale é uma aventura sobre dois irmãos durante período da peste jogo segue base do estilo narrativo com uma gameplay simples porém funcional dando foco principalmente em sua história comentando brevemente sobre jogabilidade plague tale não possui mecânicas refinadas ou grandes listas de habilidades diversas jogo resolve usar uma abordagem mais simples com apenas uma arma alguns tipos de munições que em suma maioria é utilizada de maneira pontual ao decorrer da jogatina gameplay simples relativamente repetitiva não é um problema aqui visto que jogo possui um enredo rico em detalhes que consegue desenvolver sua premissa com perfeição em um misto de momentos de ação angústia nervosismo fúria obra consegue entregar aquilo que promete muito mais conseguindo explicar os pontos que foram propostos serem explicados ao mesmo tempo que deixa pontas soltas para sua sequência plague tale requiem,0
bored me but the game looked great played nicely,1
pretty cool game like the updated looks since they fit really well with the game theme and the mario enemies overall it is delightful zelda and recommendable introduction to some of the older titles which require more backtracking and exploring every corner of the map to advance ,1
great update to one of my favourite childhood games only held back by its performance ,1
i liked this one but the dungeons felt kind of underwhelming and forgettable the puzzles were mostly fun but just felt they lacked any independent themes usually can recall few standout dungeons from each game but for this one can say can differentiate them and just played it through over the last few days ,0
artistically love this game the island setting is really refreshing and koholint is so lovely to just exist in the dreamlike nature of the narrative is super different for zelda and the way it all wraps up at the end is so nice finally meeting the wind fish waking up hearing marin song beautiful and the visual style oh my god adore how this game looks so much want every game to look like this it is so so full of charm and colour and personality give me mario game that looks like this give me pokemon game that looks like this give me fuckin gta game that looks like this genuinely what would love more than anything else in the world is for the zelda series after tears of the kingdom to come back to this style for the next mainline game don just keep this relegated to remakes if you do oracle of seasons ages give me full on original top down open world game with this visual style drop me in place as beautiful and mysterious as koholint tell me very little and let me discover it all on my own ,1
in this first game the story and switching between present day circa 2007 and the past set in the crusade era holy land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired that isn to say the game is the worst thing ever but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it tough to recommend the parkour system is very cool and has lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations scaling towers and doing leaps of faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points there are many other menial side missions that while not lacking in variety are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly play it if you re curious as some of the stealth is fun and little more low key compared to later entires in the series but don be surprised if it gets dull very quickly ,0
sinceramente eu não curti sei que é primeiro jogo que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho mas caramba é torturante escalar combate não tem diversidade nenhuma o protagonista apesar de interessante não tem quase nada de carisma sempre falando em tom neutro sem expressar emoção n para um início mesmo levando em conta as limitações ainda é bem fraco é só ver que prince of persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas mas não é que acontece basicamente jogo não tem stealth isso matou graça de muitas missões pois você basicamente chega no inimigo esfaqueia depois aperta botão para disfarçar me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos se eu falhasse ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá os guardas ficavam em alerta dificultando conseguir assassinar alvo sem falhar as vezes os npcs os loucos simplesmente me empurravam eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava missão eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que não fosse obrigado fazer para seguir com as principais que são todas praticamente iguais nada recompensadoras ,0
as someone who played assassin creed back in the day have to say that had mixed feelings about it on the one hand appreciated the game unique setting and storyline which offered fresh take on the action adventure genre the game visuals were also impressive for their time with richly detailed environments and realistic character animations ,1
weird nostalgia for this one remember my dad used to laugh when mowed the pilgrims over with my horse ,0
mortal wounds are an awful mechanic but otherwise this is easily the most straight up fun ve had so far with an rgg game ,0
judge man takes judgement into his own hands just wish tailing missions werent thing fun story and character though rggs understands why people play their games ,0
yakuza in all but name where judgment excels is in its story even the best yakuza entries inevitably devolve into flurry of preposterous plot reveals and ripped off shirts but judgment just about manages to maintain narrative coherence right up to the end credits delivering wholly satisfying and unrelentingly grim murder mystery that kept me guessing until the end d happily slot judgment into my list of essential video game stories to be experienced up there with the likes of broken sword grim fandango silent hill 2 shattered memories the longest journey max payne 2 and the last guardian the story is that good ,0
análise de judgment um spin off da franquia yakuza que nós apresenta um novo protagonista chamado ichiban novos personagens muito bens conteúdos kaito cof cof executar uma história muito acima de grande parte dos yakuza que até então 0 foi meu favorito contudo jogo está muito bem otimizado no series tem uma gameplay divertida pra caramba história cativante emocional uma soundtrack muito gostosa de ouvir minha opinião sobre jogo melhor que todos os yakuzas parabéns rgg,0
this game isn bad just couldn get into it for whatever reason ,0
amazing storyline with well written characters ryu ga gotoku studio does it again gameplay feel the same but it good as it is the city is alive as always with lots of great side quest and mini games ,1
res go ki da japanee ,0
never played it in its prime but can only imagine how awesome the mp must have been in full lobbies campaign is great zombies is good but overrated,1
the best cod banging campaign unreal multiplayer the height of zombies they ve never nailed it better than this ,1
one of the most iconic cod games and thats for good reason the amount of effort poured into making this game is immeasurable ,1
campaign was eh zombies however slaps ,0
this one is really fun time the tech is the most impressive thing about it portals that are secretly 2 second loading screens super detailed textures and animations all pop here really like the movement in the game especially when it just gives you big area and says go fast ,1
 ooh this looks pretty the game,1
this game has some real crungo writing but the combat platforming is really inganging and the seamless rift system is cool ,1
the writing feels phoned in much of the time the music is unmemorable and the game is shorter than d have liked but other than that liked it the people at insomniac know how to make fun games ,1
r rift apart looks absolutely stunning and has very fun and fluid combat with an amazing lineup of weapons my favourites being the enforcer blackhole storm and cold snap the haptic feedback with the weapons all feel great especially with the enforcer always love good shotgun there lots of neat level designs and environments that caught me off guard and were very enjoyable to play the story was entertaining enough but is forgettable the best parts involving the conflicts between the main villains and gets quite funny at times after being quite critical on future era think this is definitely step forward for the ratchet clank franchise ,1
it good to see sony classic franchises being brought back after the original game remake knew something was coming along and was right we get brand new next gen exclusive ratchet clank game without the baggage of the ps4 holding it down the franchise returns to its familiar roots which are both good and bad and ll explain why ,0
desptie being n pokemon black n the pokeopn on the box is white n that sucks,0
this game is pretty cool d love to play past the second gym someday,1
when first heard about gen 3 imagined that it was gonna look like this gen 5 is exactly what always wanted pokemon to be ,1
it is one of the best games in the series by far and just about everything works about it same thing for white ,1
fun for while,1
a fun entertaining little time that surprisingly has lot of replay value in its multiple endings but also zero replay value in that once you ve seen everything that is indeed pretty much it still absolutely worth play imo its very charming and subvertive to lot of gamer tropes and very entertaining as result definitely one of the games where once finished it makes you wanna see other people play it to see what routes they go down first ,1
forgot how meaningful most of this game actually was felt full of choices almost none of which felt like filler and never felt like it overcompensated the player most of its themes from critiquing game design and linking it to topics such as existentialism and capitalism always felt unique and tasteful ,1
managed to 100 this in less than two hours personal record for me will play this game once every couple years for the rest of my life it is just so damn good ,0
2023 the year we stop pretending this is any good,0
this game is somehow 37 years old which is crazy because without guide m sure that how long it would take someone to beat it,0
i love completing an uchikoshi game with 3 full pages of notes love busting out my little notepad and collecting clues love scouring every area for secret details love aiba ,1
what the hell,0
dogs are awesome oh and this is one of the best games of all time ,1
sim os personagens história são legais mas ainda assim mistura quebra cabeça com aventura 2 gêneros que não gosto muito então talvez culpa foi minha por não gostar tanto ,0
an excellent game ,1
missle the dog is in this game that all you need to know to get you to play it,0
ghost trick é facilmente um dos melhores jogos de ds não bastando sua gameplay única diversificada com touch cada puzzle é único sua narrativa contextualiza de forma genial suas ghost tricks seu cast principal é perfeito não só tem uma construção boa pro seu propósito como transmitem vida com ajuda das animações fabulosas até mesmo extravagantes que tornam satisfatório cada momento que você não está no controle ouso dizer ainda que ign está errada linearidade da obra torna crível funcional no meio de tudo que engloba não é um defeito n trilha sonora arrebenta composições extremamente boas para seus momentos efeitos sonoros de alta qualidade n texto é muito bom sabendo que nenhuma explicação seria boa suficiente foca na sua temática de morte arrependimento destino causa consequência ao invés de se demorar com origem do seu poder ainda sim sua explicação é aceitável se torna um bom recurso de roteiro até que se prove contrário é passível de não ter furos de roteiro ou pontas soltas sendo gratificante cada mistério resolvido inserido construção para grand finale não poderia ser melhor,0
pretty wild that this was made by the same people as ace attorney considering that ace attorney sucks and this rocks ,0
it is the most alrightest modern dragon quest m glad finally saw it through in my quest to beat all the dragon quests it the top of the middle of the pack and great place to start ,1
epic adventure,0
lo pude jugar cuando me rostice la pierna no podia ir trabajar por una semana me hizo olvidar que cuando daba un paso mi pierna se desintegraba nada que ver la reseña pero bueno que tal todo bien yo maso pero al menos ya se me curo la pierna,0
i feel like have to get myself into the certain mindset where can enjoy dragon quest after playing more intense jrpgs for while had fun with this but the plot of this game especially the postgame time travel stuff felt incredibly mishandled and actually undid what small part of this story where the protagonist loses and veronica sacrifices herself even though wasn much of fan of this game it did encourage me to play the others,0
cozy jrpg haven played any other dq games but this was really nice experience although the formula is simple it made interesting by the amount of skills and upgrades the characters would ve never met but now we ve got full party sure hope we don have to fight god ,0
so what the hell is act 3 ,0
i haven technically completed it yet the final boss is super fucking hard ,0
i know most folks are kinda sick of hearing people praise this game nowadays but still that for reason it still masterpiece ,1
very good game but was dumb as fuck and thought this was the first paper mario game,0
the statue with the face of the canva liberté guidant le peuple love that statue n could say lot but just believe me it ,0

efinitely wish liked this game more but can enjoy it as much as others aqui é onde mais maior acerta porque é uma melhoria muito grande do que primeiro jogo da franquia tinha traz ainda uma continuação da história ainda mais interessante novas mecânicas inimigos pluzzes enfim é um jogo incrivel um tanto frente dos jogos da sua época tal como comenté en la n reseña del anterior n god of war tiene un sistema de pelea que se hace repetitivo aburrido con el paso de las horas en este juego se han intensificado la falta de novedades en la jugabilidad se han recoloreado las habilidades de kratos aunque no aporten algo muy distinto la experiencia del primero en cuanto historia me ha dejado bastante frío es un pelín mejor que la del primer juego pero nada del otro mundo sigue pecando de falta de complejidad he notado hasta un exceso de puzzles con mecánicas parecidas otra vez al primer juego am what the gods have made me ,1
i commander shepard and this is my favorite game on the citadel ,1
i love that the plot is getting all your cool alien friends together want new mass effect that has no suicide mission at the end where you get to hang out with your cool alien friends,0
love this game for allowing me to change my stupid character from 1 to look better it excellent this game taught me how to graft ,1
 played before 2023 n as someone who doesn really enjoy sci fi settings or rpgs this is one of my favorite games of all time everything good about the first game is still there the combat has been streamlined and improved and you have so many companions with their own unique aspects and quests this game companion system is absolutely top tier with emotional stories loyalty and consequences for your choices that haven seen in any other game can talk much more about this without spoiling it but god damn it is good am shocked at how much enjoyed this game as only played it because wanted to speedrun it did not expect to enjoy it so much casually ,1
there a lot of third person shooter gameplay in this role playing game very strange ,0
if have to listen to levitating one more god damn time,0
i hate videogames,0
car diversity is amazing despite map is so large urban sites are so restricted and the whole city is soulles so there is no traffic at all however events are so various and the handling is so smooth ,0
i am still salty that this was sold as separate game and wasn just the opening mission to phantom pain ,0
the most fun part of this game is learning all the paths through the relatively small map and using those new routes to get ranks in all the missions ,0
weirdly more consistent video game than the phantom pain,0
this game unfortunately didn live up to my expectations still good none the less ,1
it good great even but actually wanted to fight some of those alien commanders suda,1
suda saw that travis would only be mii fighter in smash ultimate and took that personally,0
graphic design is my passion the video game,1
i a bit mixed on this one while the good parts are great the game also suffers in few areas really like the combat in this one and new mechanics like the mech thing are really cool and it fun to stack damage on enemies ,1
great game awful optimization n putting aside the obvious graphical and level design mess n the game for some reason launches steam vr whenever turn it on the vsynch doesnt work durring cutscenes for some reason the game also crashed multiple times and the fact that it has no auto save meant lost tons of progress also the fans on my pc turn so fast that feel like its gonna take off which could be potential risk of hardware damage n but still cant hate on it too much since the core game is great it feels like everything grasshopper and suda had been working towards since the first game,0
the open world somehow felt more bland than the original wii version of santa destroy and you could make far more money refighting bosses at your home as opposed to doing the odd jobs around the map other than however pretty alright no more heroes game personally feel that 2 was better ,0
one of the best 3d platformers ever imo,1
picking up hundreds of collectables is tedious and awful but if you inject the right amount of nostalgia into it then m willing to put up with anything also the quiz at the end is legitimately fun and will not let anyone tell me otherwise ,1
sort of perfected the collect thon formula for me at least think its my favourite n64 platformer obviously it owes everything to mario 64 but feel this just expanded that formula and used the basis for loads of really creative level designs and use of music ,1
an awesome trip down playstation memory lane hunting down all of the museum artifacts and seeking out game references was amazing music was too catchy and stuck in my head for days after finishing ,1
it a decent time waster and m enough of nerd to get lot of the references they made but this game did not feel like it had much substance ,0
if sony wanted to show the capabilities of the new dualsense controller they easily could ve done 5 minute guide which gives you the new features and how you can use them but instead they went the extra mile and made very fun yet simple game which is both informative and celebration of playstation history of their technology and game series with the levels being themed around different parts of the console and level design being very creative as to how they can show off the new features this makes for one of the most memorable tech demos just due to how refreshing it is with the ways it teaches you about the ps5 ,1
all of these pretentious mfs actin like this is the best cod no it aint ,1
the last good cod nuff said ,1
helllll yeah,0
best cod and that not just nostalgia talking campaign multiplayer league play and zombies were all great,1
the dihareeha encrusted diaper of the legend of zelda franchise,0
fun zelda game just hated some parts and the imprisoned sucks,0
the second zelda game ve beaten and my first 3d zelda beaten this game is amazing the new joystick controls work well mostly and the game itself is super fun to play the puzzles are fun the story is great origin story for the series groose the music is amazing definitely give this one play even if it just to see lord groose character development ,1
n merece hate,0
zelda month chronological order,1
awesome game if there were just one mega man entry in the whole franchise had to recommend to someone it would be this one even though it isn my favorite game just because of how rock solid and consistent the entire experience is ,1
só não consigo dar uma nota maior porque tem outros melhores ,0
truly the most replayable game ever when you know all the optimal routes and learn enough for minimal backtracking truly an amazing game,1
poucos problemas gameplay absurda de boa ,0
in some aspects think this game is little overrated but in lot of other aspects think it holds up just as much as people say designwise this game is fantastic with the level design and game control being top notch for the super nintendo m not the biggest fan of the snes sound chip so the ost was pretty big miss for me personally but the songs are indeed well composed liked this game enough to 100 it so take with that as you will one of the classics on the snes for sure ,1
the kind of game thought would love on paper but once started playing just kinda lost interest fairly quickly people who completed it all say its amazing and might go back one day but ive tried twice now and both times just dropped it after about 3 hours ,1
fun but empty just like ocean,1
great game,1
easily one of the best survival games available the cycle of finding new materials and blueprints and bringing them back to base to build something better to go exploring with provides constant stream of good chemicals in the brain only issue may be the lack of direction near the mid late period as well as the repeated back tracking when descending deeper but when look at the stars m reminded of god infinite love and beauty extends to the high heavens not just earth can sinner be welcome to heaven can has eternal salvation is for me ,0
as they become increasingly few and far between my appreciation of games that totally grab your brain and won let go deepens in tandem ,1
 played before 2023 n loved this game the setting is unique and the main character is one of my favorite in games selene is such cool determined character and really loved the combat and effects this was really the first next gen game played on the ps5 and it didn disappoint my main issue is that it is roguelike but it doesn have any replabilitiy really didn feel any reason to go back through this game and only came back after my initial playthrough for the dlc which definitely helps me want to replay through it but you can really control or change builds to have drastically different play styles you re still dodging and shooting with an active reload for the most part and that is it with the variety coming from the enemies and biomes hope we get sequel that turns it into true roguelike letting me focus on melee or dashing or tanking shots or being glass cannon or something to add more variety that this game needed ,0
muito muito bom antes de jogar returnal já havia visto um vídeo cheio de spoilers lido diversas críticas do jogo mas mesmo assim experiência foi fantástica descobrir os mistérios dos biomas entender helios por conseguinte quem é protagonista são questões criadas através do gameplay com maestria ,0
i remember playing this with friends lot and it very nostalgic for me the disc eventually stopped playing few minutes into the game but it was loved ,1
i will never forgive this game for starting the whole wii wii mario blandness era new super mario bros ds was fun unique and creative this one makes me shudder in disgust because it was the first of what would be three new super mario bros sequels it represents everything wrong with the boring age of mario games in the late 2000s early 2010s ,0
it very in character for 2d mario to pump out something that actually super good then immediately ruin it by taking inspiration from some of my least favorite places in the franchise,1
really nice character writing and worldbuilding only wish it was longer so the characters could be fleshed out more have yet to play the additional content so it could fix this complaint,0
citizen sleeper n has dense sometimes even suffocating atmosphere one full of textures the sleeper synthetic skin the ink black color and consistency of space sensations the cold floor and the annoying flickering of the lights colors in the outlandish outfits of the characters smells and tastes the spiciness and rich flavour of emphir fungus sounds the mechanical whirring and the bleep bloop ,0
satisfying and hopeful lovely ,1
a rare game that seamlessly melds the core game mechanic into rich world built on layers of narrative and some killer art and sound spend 5 minutes on n the eye n and it ll feel like you ve lived your whole sleeper life there spend 1 hour on n the eye n and for all it rusted containers failing life support and crushing spiraling n existence n you ll want to call it home ,0
with art by guillaume singelin and music and sound design by amos roddy gareth damian martin n citizen sleeper n is genuinely gorgeous and rich game that gently reminds you that staying still is not always the best option even if you manage to pull yourself or get pulled into better place it also gently compels you to think about those moments in your life where sacrifices or compromises had to be made and how the choice to make them wasn always voluntary n nor was it always yours to make in the first place ,1
i feel the mechanical nakedness of this game is both blessing and curse at first was worried that it would hurt immersion but the great characters and fantastic ambience music design dragged me fully in after the first 20 or so minutes even found that the nakedness of the system made you really feel what your impact in the world is and really highlighted the sense of player agency which is plentiful in this game ,0
eine öde story gameplay welches deine zeit verschwendet eine schwache auswahl an minigames und viele technische probleme mit dem remaster machen es zu einem yakuza titel welcher wirklich nur für fans genießbar ist ,0
i remember hearing from people that this was one of the weakest entries in the series and like eh nah don see it liked the okinawa vibes too much to really dislike this the pacing for the plot was definitely little weird but it still had its cool moments that enjoyed the enemies definitely do block bit too much tho ,1
super wacky goofy fun times yes,0
gm_construct bizim üniye benziyo,0
this game isn that fun to me anymore for the same reason that playing with legos isn that fun to me anymore didn stop me from somehow sinking over 800 hours into it when was younger though ,0
its pretty good single player fps heard lot of good stuff but it doesn really do anything special both in terms of narrative and gameplay ,1
decent enough single player fps doesnâ do anything too special but nothing stands out as bad ,0
my second fave wolfenstein after return first game bought when got my ps4 and it was jaw dropping just dope console shooter ,0
wish could play more from this series but this is genuinely so scary can ðÿ xadðÿ xadðÿ xadðÿ xad was made for baby games,0
i think it was too long sometimes but worth experience,1
there a part where you are trying to avoid capture and are supposed to back track to an escape helicopter you are intercepted by big blockade around the whole area but with the helicopter there far back in the distance knew this was supposed to be one of the goats with choosing your own path so used my elder scrolls platforming skills to jank around one of the barriers and felt satisfied on attaining what knew must be difficult branch in the story ,0
in more combative place in my life was vocally against this game and told lots of people about this view point someone at the time rebuked me with shut up and eat your fucking vegetables and honestly they kinda had point ,0
do you have single fact to back that up ,0
i find myself in the odd position of struggling to write about n deus ex n the game felt longer than it actually was engrossing in way haven really experienced d consider myself good fan of immersive sims and it isn hard to see why this is considered as essential as it is n n deus ex n is by far the most accessible of its peers where games like n system shock 2 n or n vampire the masquerade bloodlines n had great diversity in buildcrafting and emergent gameplay there was always an almost cruel sense that there was specific comically unspecified character that large chunk of the games were designed for perhaps the absence of this ill balancing alone is what made n deus ex n more popular than its contemporaries but such an assessment perhaps fails to do justice to the feats of design that elevates it so much higher n n deus ex n doesn have even close to the same sense of aesthetics of other role playing games of its era rather unremarkable soundtrack with no astounding moments of art direction to really speak of there is great detail in its real estate but other than that one could not find the common constituents of game atmosphere to draw in through naturalistic ways so why then is n deus ex n so deeply immersive dynamism never before has world felt as reactive as this there is only one true instance where the world is not completely open ended to you where the game of the year version has made progressing to the level 2 labs of versalife impossible to do before returning to tong other than that every area puts the ball in your court if you can dream up solution chances are it can be done npcs objectives access to areas all remains seamless and alters accordingly pick up key before talking to an npc who tells you to go get it its not just that denton will be quick to mention this its the fact that you could potentially just walk past the npc entirely and get the move on there no disconnect in decision making you ll feel connected to denton the way you should playing game like this ,0
don remember it at all like anything about it in the slightest ,1
bioshock 2 definitely doesn do everything better than the first game but actually still enjoy it ever so slightly more the guns are better playing as big daddy and using the drill is awesome you can use weapons and plasmids at the same time and the entire plasmid system is expanded upon pretty massively to the point where you become insanely overpowered basically everything gameplay related especially combat is improved upon significantly it has bit of slow start and some of the changes are little awkward to get used to at first but it only gets better as it progresses better to have that than be like the first game and hit its peak too early ,1
the writing is sometimes really bad but usually just bland the gameplay though is great it fixes lot of the issues had with the first game gameplay wise ,0
kinda mid but ringo hot,1
i wish ringo was in game actually enjoyed playing ,1
sem entrar em spoilers eu genuínamente acho que falam mal demais desse jogo apesar de todas as críticas que eu possa ter ele ,0
een while since ve have this many mixed feelings a,0
t megaten game can say it as bad as people make it o,0
ton of tedious things in this game always just makes me return to other roguelites after spending 50 minutes on another mostly empty run,0
my favorite twin stick shooter as of writing,1
this game is so much fun the concept is awesome the gameplay is awesome the game is challenging but not as unfair as feel rogue like games can be sometimes beware this game is extremely challenging and will require time investment in order to enjoy to the fullest especially if you are unfamiliar with bullet hell games the game is humorous and polished the game is packed with content variety and endless new experiences am not fan of rogue like games generally but this game was the exception to the rule ,1
an arcade journey through the mysterious world of texas ,0
peak fiction more like mid fiction,0
not unproblematic but this game art and sound direction is incredible and its earnest hopeful and so n real n portrayal of trauma means lot to me ,0
this game will preach empathy and love to victims of all kinds of bigotry except racism and then woobify the weird pedophilic relationship abhorrently inconsistent and just miserable to think about worsened by how average and unremarkable so much of the game strengths feel beyond the 2 obvious highlight characters just read umineko instead if you want to see this sort of story done with any tact and more interesting writing to boot one of the most disappointing experiences ve ever had with game ,0
this was such an incredible unique experience to read through the story the aesthetics and soundtrack are all so captivating found myself falling more and more enchanted in each part went through the stories and its characters this vn through its heartbreaking tragic and yet bittersweet story telling has impacted me to the point dont think would forget story like it ,0
i can put into words how much loved this story think writing anything about this game will ruin it charm so please read and witness one of the best love stories of all time ,1
it genuinely impossible to fully convey the experience of going through this vn please give it try if you re willing to deal with its honestly kinda bad pacing issues even so loved this ,0
you ll love this game if you grew up on nes snes games you ll also probably like it if you just like action platformers in general really solid game also it is not metroidvania if thats what anyone is looking for ,1
this game is the poster child for 8 bit throwback games and with good reason it basically captures the nes era of games the best it possibly can while also bringing it up to date with modern design conventions it basically the gold standard for those kinds of games so if you fancy yourself nice 2d platformer and want solidly good 8 bit throwback this is your game theres also ton of free bonus campaigns in this game but still haven played those yet should get around to doing that someday ,1
shovel knight seriously rocks what really shines is the level design soundtrack and main mechanic of bouncing with the shovel the death defying jumps make the game stressful but it doesn make it too challenging would give this one try if you like 2d platformers it seriously is classic ,0
here a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty do you actively avoid playing games from the pre 3d era because of their lack of availability or because their foundation is comparatively primitive and therefore jarringly inaccessible the reason can be because these games are locked in an archival vault for they are commonly ported to modern platforms it must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date mon fess up m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections but there seems to be widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception especially those of the early pixelated 2d period released before the late 1990s sneering distaste for the classics isn as pervasive with films or music zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001 space odyssey high as kite and emphatically detail their transcendental experience to their peers with pulp fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms no one is delusional enough to place the prequels or disney star wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age maybe it because spend too much time on the internet but ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is more common practice among teenagers now than it was when was in high school older video games on the other hand are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts admittedly as someone born in the early 3d era many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating can count merely handful of games that were released before was born that are among my personal favorites as there is only so much pain can handle before my spirit shatters and am in dire need of relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort conversely there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era and the shift to 3d left them bewildered they ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal after certain point where the gaming industry reached point of proficiency with 3d visuals to an almost cinematic extent games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork one of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old school revival games was shovel knight 2d side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers ,0
a walking simulator with an uninteresting story about grief with questionable writing and voice acting fire watch teases supernatural horror elements but doesn actually have any is just game where you move forward and some guy whines about how sad he is ,0
it has such great atmosphere and then just totally flops at the end maybe that what they were going for but it didn do much for me ,1
walking simulator nothing special but really enjoyed it,1
this game is that simple kind of genius that leaves you hungry for more the fact that we have not gotten single game that captures this game feeling since then is eating my stomach from the inside out ,0
structural issues and awkward world design mixed with solid gameplay also dont remember single boss ,0
the game probably has one of the best set of characters in the series lucatiel creighton and pate are genuinely amazing but hafta be real with ya everything else ranges from really great to dear god what is this,1
the conversations around this game have revolved into twisted form of mockery ,0
that literally the worst dark souls but at the same time my favorite one ,1
this is by far the hardest souls game for me fume knight killed me far too many times the story and atmosphere is similar to that of 1 good ,0
nota disso aqui na dlc pq eu sou burro,0
while the gameplay can be bit stiff think the plateforming is really not the best aspect of the game there are few collisions problem still enjoyed playing this game enough to do multiple playthroughs n but more than gameplay what stood out for me is the lore and its inspirations the art direction and the beautiful pixel art also really like discovering every new gore finishing move animation haha n really curious to see the sequel ,1
que lore foda gameplay bonitinho mas namoral quase chorei de raiva por causa dos 2 ultimos boss do jogokkkkkkkkk que desgraça,0
quando criatividade estilo conseguem simplesmente carregar um jogo arte supera qualquer orçamento blasphemous traz uma visão perturbadora dantesca de um mundo apocalíptico visceral governado por um deus misterioso tortuoso em infindável punição dos pecadores que habitam ,0
did you know final fantasy xiv now has freetrial with the new heavensward expa anyways really wish had friends to play this with me ,1
a realm reborn is alright at the best of times and utterly painful at worst but it gets pass due to preceding some incredible stories that wouldn be the same without it ,0
it turns out don enjoy how mmorpgs work triple triad is great though ,1
tldr arr starts slow but gets good played and dropped this game the first time before the story got good which is shame but made the second time around 8 months later an even better experience would recommend anybody to play this game if they re willing to be patient when it comes to the story becoming interesting and if they have somebody to play this game with it not necessary and this game can honestly be played solo but you re missing out on lot if you re not interacting with anybody in an mmo loved it and can wait to start heavensward when have the time to devote myself to it ,1
the lastest game from san barlow the creator of her story and telling lies comes another fmv game where the game part is less and less important it took me hours before felt understood the purpose of anything was doing in this game get m watching clips of story out of order but game like her story at least had it make sense and gave you goal from the start here it aimless watching of three different movies out of order until you get the twist and then it just becomes mindless hunt ,0
this was some crazy stuff ,0
three intriguing and well shot films expose little by little subplot that both sinister and fanatical it at the expense of being little repetitive going through and clicking things beautifully acted and sam barlow and team continue to challenge the notion of what constitutes video game ,0
immortality conta história de marissa marcel marissa estrelou 3 filmes porem nenhum deles chegou sequer n ser lançado navegando por fragmentos perdidos de gravações dos filmes estrelados por marissa marcelo resta n ao jogador descobrir verdade entender que aconteceu com marissa marcel n immortality possui uma gameplay completamente diferente do convencional jogo nos apresenta uma série de n clipes dos antigos filmes estrelados por marissa nosso trabalho é analisar cada um dos clipes para descobrir n verdade por trás do desaparecimento da atriz história é complexa difícil de ser entendida primeiro n momento porem isso te instiga investigar descobrir os segredos escondidos nas gravações n immortality é um jogo narrativamente muito bom porem difícil de ser entendido talvez não seja um jogo n para todos porem com certeza cumpre seu papel em instigar jogador descobrir uma verdade oculta ,0
sam barlow has been inovating in interactive narratives in amazing ways for long time does not get enough credit think since silent hill shattered memories which is masterpiece in storytelling he has been introducing amazing ideas in new ways on how to tell story ,1
ive played 2 hours of this game and the amount of visual errors and pure laziness in series that thrives on environmental design is depressing ,0
i ve never played game that can figure out what it wanted to be the whole story is mess campaigns are split between action horror fighting and puzzles and unnecessary qtes,0
garbage,0
i mean it better in co op with friend so you can laugh through the insufferable repetitive wtf sections story was chill idk man it just eh chris best look tho 3,0
i only really recommend it in co op but it a fun co op experience even with all the jank and poorly designed bits the shooting and combat mechanics are both top notch and really carry the game ,1
crush you graaaaah ,0
after the huge disappointment that 2 was this was ridiculously surprising with the quality was presented the story is good and gameplay mechanics like the combo sytem keep you completely immersed all the time you play it ,0
devil may cry 3 é sem sombras de duvidas uma revolução na franquia dmc jogo veio com uma pegada muito mais única original do que seus antecessores trouxeram dmc3 não tem medo de mudar ele levou franquia para um lado mais cômico estiloso insano n acredito que depois do fracasso que foi dmc2 capcom não podia ter acertado mais com esse game pois tudo que vimos depois na franquia tem algum ponto de inspiração no dmc3 n dante veio com uma pegada muito mais badass nesse game aumentando muito seus números de piadas lutas estilosas isso deixou personagem muito mais único que nos games anteriores isso sem falar de todo elenco de personagens que tem muito mais foco grandeza nesse capítulo da série joguem dmc3 ,0
amazing acting amazing story amazing art direction amazing ambience and world building the minute to minute gameplay is alright ,1
at first was skeptical did the game and dlc need remake the answer is yes the improvements are delight for the eyes the gameplay is well refined and its fits now graphically perfectly with the sequel ,1
still as good as ever,1
 played before 2023 n for the full review just check my review of the n original n it is the same exact game basically with coat of paint big issue though is the fact that there is no multiplayer which think they should ve ported over but get why they didn want to ,0
amazing game,1
rage inducing mechanical behemoth ,0
 played before 2023 n honestly don remember much from this game other than beating it and few other things never got super frustrated but it had fun levels and cute artstyle definitely not my type of gameplay though ,0
precision platforming perfection,1
mid 2000 stoner humor packed into an artificially difficult platformer apparently that what the indie world wanted back in 2010 because super meat boy exploded in popularity ,0
i was kinda disapoiinted with the difficulty as finished the full game on my first session with it but the game was fun and addicting enough to make me want to play the full story in one sitting so that shows how much fun the game really is ,0
an iconic sci fi whole greater than the sum of its parts ,1
best story with amazing characters crushed with garbage ending ,0
the game itself is worth 4 5 leaning on five almost every single player dlc is in the this collection except pinnacle station though that isn a loss if you re ever so inclined you can restore it using mod ,0
i had always heard good things about the mass effect series but never got to experience them until this was released love any type of game that lets me build and act out character as see fit and being able to take said character through three different games and let them flesh out is truly immersive experience enjoyed downright every second of this game yes even me1 and would gladly recommend it to any rpg fan out there ,1
parece um jogo bem besta eu não tenho menor interesse em jogar isso mas arte é bonitinha,1
this was puzzle game and łukasz drew art for it wow ,1
a great game and funny puzzle and the sexy girls make it much more likely n 7 4,1
fun one sitting game,1
it was alright lol my first mainline pokemon game and had so much fun catching and exploring but the quality and graphics weren the best ,1
bland pokemon game why do you all keep buying these games ,0
it good for first time,1
ya cute there are better pokemon games but think this was pretty fun,1
i never played the original crash trilogy on the psx but felt that this remakes were pretty amazing upgrades for people looking to experience the original crash bandicoot gameplay some lovely track remixes as well only struggle really had was warped time trials and bonus stages ,0
never played the original games but hoo boy it looks like missed out on some good shit,0
great revisit to ps1 classic that made part of my childhood ,1
isth fweakin cwash bandicoot,0
it was hard but fully completed them,0
faithful recreations with the right amount of artistic changes and added time trials to all three games makes this solid collection of some of the best precision platformers ,1
fucking love tetris timeless game ,0
a great colorful port of the arcade classic featuring two game modes ,1
hard tetris game to go wrong with albeit not as iconic as the game boy version the type is your classic endless game of tetris and the type involves clearing certain amount of garbage blocks plays by asshole tetris rules where blocks are pure random so you can get completely screwed by rng my major gripe with this game is the controls moving blocks left to right is very slow and it feels like the blocks rotate in way where keep accidentally misplacing them no hard drops either respect the people that play this competitively for learning how to master the controls because sure as hell had hard time getting the ending of the game by clearing level 9 speed 5 height game is total crap shoot due to the rng of what blocks you get and the arrangement of the garbage blocks so just stick to the game not my favorite version of tetris but still does the job ,0
bem simples mas exige bastante estratégia sorte mesmo não curtindo muito seu gênero consigo me divertir um pouquinho vale pena jogar pelo valor histórico ,0
corporate garbage,0
i hate life,0
consegue ser pior que lol,0
just not my sort of game dont hate it though,0
i wish they would stop making fps games where moving your character while shooting gives them parkinson ,1
é meu game de plantaforma preferido ja zerei diversas vezes nunca deixa de ser divertido pode ser jogado com até 4 pessoas ,1
best mario game have ever played this game is pure joy ,1
3d land ma meglio tornare usare più personaggi è una boccata aria fresca il multiplayer è divertentissimo per quanto non sia studiato per questo il gioco level design stellare soddisfacente da completare un po un peso completare tutti livelli con tutti personnaggi ,0
great gameplay and the pacing of the gunplay is far more restrained than the last row things which is really good however the story while entertaining as always thanks to excellent acting and character interaction is filled with plot holes and side plots that go nowhere which is why deducted the extra half start from the score besides that it an on par if not slightly improved gameplay experience from n among thieves n ,1
awarded bonus half star for introducing charlie cutter,1
why all don like this one it great,1
remember when greg miller gave this 10 10 and everyone lost their minds that was laugh ,0
god these games are so frustrating some times but damn they re good,0
ace attorney at its best this one is more ace attorney but it puts so many spins on the formula that everything feels new ,1
i liked this game but found godot to be pretty annoying tbh,1
kino based raw peak fiction etc etc ,0
the only game from the original trilogy that the fandom has the right opinion about,1
fey supremacy,1
such an unique experience love it,1
yume nikki love you,1
yume nikki is one of those games often point to in conversation with fellow designers as shining example of how well video game can capture specific person experience these types of rpg maker horror games usually get bad rap they are often cheap products made by inexperienced designers who believe that mashing teenage girl protagonists with horrific set pieces will instantly make work profound yume nikki does not deserve to be lumped in with the contemporaries kikiyama the developer managed to extract clever narrative meaning within the bounds of rpg maker limited toolset in way that left me genuinely floored this game is best approached completely blind so will refrain from saying any details but it has transformed the way approach experiential design even if the games want to make look nothing like this ,0
looking at weird shit is fun and this has plenty more weird things going on than my boring ass dreams,0
um tps com um level design excelente história boa gameplay muito satisfatória pérola do ps2 ,1
alright here we go my name is chatgpt and ve seen my fair share of dark days but today m here to talk about game that hits close to home max payne ,0
max payne still rules at times it can be little difficult and repetitive but the bullet time campy plot and cinematic flair make it must play ,0
max payne is such good game with some crippling problems that really date it the voice acting is top tier and james mccaffrey is the biggest reason for this success and is one of the best voice actors ever the gameplay is unqiue and so satisfying diving through the air as the world explodes around you and bullets whiz past you the depiction of new york as this grim snowy crime ridden land fits so well with the place and the cheesiness makes this so good but played this on the pc port and the game crippling issues with the difficulty slider got annoying really quick walking through door and getting insta headshot three times and then the fourth time doing the same thing and not having it happen got annoying and supposedly there is major bug that makes it so the difficulty slider which is tied to the only difficulty you can play at the start is broken and doesn properly balance the game as well some aspects feel little too gamey in this serious tale with few levels sticking out like sore thumb the underground level feel enemy variety wasn really thing just the same enemy that got stronger and stronger but overall this is very good game with aspects that haven ever really been replicated as well which is shame we need more top tier slow mo shooters ,0
nunca consegui passar da primeira noite aaaaaaaaaa,0
a gameplay é solida divertida ,1
this game ruined my life,0
this is the scariest game ve ever played the jumpscares had me jumping in fear the freddy fazbear is so scary,0
near perfect sequel to dkc music is fantastic the level themes of pirate ships and spooky forests are fun and the secret world is lots of fun ,1
this sequel holds up but with the novelty gone it took solid level design to keep people interested and that game delivers ,1
all time great if you could only play one donkey kong country game of the trilogy this is the one the graphics are yet more refined from the previous entry and still hold up in shocking feat for early 3d cg the levels are even more fun now with less of the unfun types of levels from the previous game barrel levels and the minecart levels are actually very fun here in addition the secrets in this game are more fun to go after with more substantial rewards plus the new level elements and animal buddies are cool to toy with n this is all without the major haymaker this game hits you with the n music n man this is legit among the best video game soundtracks of all time it timeless and composer david wise work here is at it master craft status the soundtrack graphics and level design all work in symphony to craft this masterpiece of platformer ,1
i won mince my words here the last month has been bit underwhelming don get me wrong there have been some solid titles that finally got to finish and everything been interesting enough to where still wrote about it but nothing quite blown my mind recently flywrench might have set the bar bit too high for better or for worse so it looks like it time for another nostalgia reset what better way to get myself back in gear than to go back to the source consider this write up follow up to my original n donkey kong country n piece since think ve fleshed out obstacle escalation theory ton by this point ll focus more on differences between the two games this time around ,0
this is as close to perfection you can get for 2d platformer it oozes atmosphere while having varied themes and locations and the game rewards those who goes the extra mile to nab all the secrets with extra levels casually or completionist doesn matter there a great and challenging game in store for you ,1
unova has the best pokémon designs honestly best gen tbh,1
for generation that is supposedly reinvention of the series this game sure is full of the same shit as all the rest 5th gen includes the very worst of pokemon design at times making exciting fire breathing monsters into demented mundanity ,0
nostalgia bias 2nd best pokemon game the best one is the sequal,1
possibly the ugliest generation in pokemon history which is very low bar considering gens 8 9 and 4 gen 5 also has easily the worst ou meta in the franchise history but at least uu is fun and lot of the new monster designs are cool ,0
n gotta be enough to play this game best pokemon game and probably will continue to be so ,1
 played before 2023 n this is probably the best non combat horror game ve played but really hate non combat horror games because it takes away lot of choices you can make which makes it scarier to me it isn that scary gameplay wise when my only option is to run down hallway and hide in locker or bed the asylum is cliche but fun setting but m not that impressed with the game like lot of other peple are think it just came out at good time where most of thse type of games and still now were cheap lazy works or were created by one single person ,1
nice atmosphere the rest is okay as you probably know the game is mostly walking through corridors did still enjoy the main campaign but things got old fast in the dlc ,1
classico dos jogos de terror foda,0
realmente muito bom mudou gênero dos jogos de terror isso é inegavel agora se mudou pra melhor questionavel já tinha zerado antes,0
very ok to be honest,1
acima da média de 90 dos jogos de terror dá pra se divertir se assustar bastante especialmente com cadeirante ,0
so much better than 2 n with 2 got slightly bored but this kept my attention throughout,0
i no good at this game but it cool ,1
o terceiro jogo da saga reboot de hitman segue mesma linha de seus dois antecessores você vai jogar em 6 cenários diferentes cada um com alvos únicos que podem ser eliminados de inúmeras maneiras possíveis de um tiro à queima roupa uma morte acidental forte desse jogo é sua rejogabilidade onde cada missão pode ser completa de várias maneiras diferentes quanto sua história um enredo simples porém bom bastante para te entreter pelo tempo que você irá jogar uma primeira jogatina pode levar até 12 horas para ser completa seguindo as 6 missões principais porém versão trilogy versão incluída no xbox game pass trás de volta as 12 missões de hitman 1 2 resultando em boas horas ao lado do agente 47 ,0
i wish the final level was better,1
i really like the potential stuff you can do in this game,1
another walking simulator with stupidly easy puzzles and platforming no fail states or challenge of any kind but the art style does make it at least interesting to look at for while ,0
i loved sable from its gorgeous visuals to its beautiful music and meaning ve lost track of time exploring the world and its different biomes talking to strange characters climbing huge areas etc performance may be little bit wacky at times on pc but overall it was great experience cannot but recommend it to anyone looking for wholesome open world adventure that doesn length too much ,1
initially awesome open world exploration game that suffers from overambition but still provides worthwhile journey n intriguing fantasy desert setting with lot of alien structures and cultures to discover n simple and short story that delivers its theme of finding purpose in freedom excellently n unique art style with little to no shading and shifting colors to make for constantly changing impressions n light environmental puzzles and decent collectibles strewn about just right to fill the map n well thought out movement mechanics in climbing gliding and driving that are built to fit the world and not the other way around as is often the case n overly restrained soundtrack with couple amazing songs being hidden in favor of unremarkable ambiance n clunky physics most noticeable on the essential bike n terrible performance as well as frequent glitches of all kinds,0
a cute little mess way too ambitious for its own good ,1
i like how the for also works as 4 ,1
the one that was fun for its time but not worth playing anymore ,1
this feels soooo slow to return to,0
alas this game was my breaking point for this series like brawl got really swept up in the hype cycle and was so excited to play this when it was announced followed every character announcement and direct all the way to launch where proceeded to play the everloving shit out of it also wanted to be more competitive so started like really grinding this game both online and offline and really all was doing was just burning myself out at an insane rate this game series slowly stopped becoming the special highlight of get togethers and started becoming exhausting can look back at this game in positive light like can for all the previous smash games before it because of that plus smash games before this were unique enough from one another that there enough reason to keep all the previous games around whereas for this game now that ultimates out who the hell is still trying to play this the game is solid but like m still burnt out on this series and have this game and myself to blame ,0
this was one of the first smash bros games ever played and its pretty good to say the least really like how there is lot of content lot of characters and overall just lot of everything for everyone to enjoy really like the concept of having it be cross platform with the 3ds version ,1
very fun game this is where it feels the kirby series truly began as if n kirby dream land n simply acted as prototype for this one the spritework is very charming on the nes the songs are so catchy that they re often remixed into modern games without feeling out of place and the copy ability is fun to tool with even with only one move for each ability also love hi jump ,1
cute little game liked this one lot ,1
poyo fun game,1
massive improvement from kirby dream land the bosses were much more fun and harder the moon and sun the big cloud king dedede and the final boss who made me feel as if was playing gradius for the arcade ahh good nostalgia right there man love it it was genuinely fun ,1
incredibly impressive for an nes title but doesn run the greatest still great game and introduces the copy ability series staple ,1
i don like the extra mode,1
a kazuya mishima bodypillow is the smartest economic investment bandai namco can make rn thats all im gonna say,1
the online sucks and the rest is alright guess ,0
i have no idea what the fuck is going on in the story mode,0
march 2023 n for the last 3 years this game was too much of reminder of my ex for me should get down on my knees give thanks that the tekken8 trailers are triggering nostalgia instead of triggering resentment and ptsd aftershocks u0001fae3 tekken7 convinced me to buy my first gaming console since middle school to bond with my gamer gf absolutely wasn ready for her to show me her own rage drive more people should talk about how domestic abuse is statistically higher in lgbt relationships ,0

to many this is the best game out of the entire kingodm hearts series and to be fair there a lot going for this game as with many square enix games they always deliver when it comes to music overall aesthetics especially when compared to kh1 other final fantasy titles the gameplay is greatly improved upon over kingdom hearts 1 in almost every regard camera movement combat platforming everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed with that being said this is where the story begins to take nosedive in every direction personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the roxas portion of the game without skipping cutscenes it going to take long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable ,1
in my review of kh1 remarked on how if played these games as kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites mostly due to how the game had sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was disney title this game felt like it had better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime ass vibes that square enix was known for combined those two elements make for game that feel if had played as kid it would have changed things the same way sonic adventure 2 did for me that right there is powerful energy that can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone unfortunately played this little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally but absolutely recognize that power when see it the game pretty much improves upon the first in every way with better locales fancier and flashier gameplay more intricate plot the whole nine yards my only major gripe that have with it is think the second half could have been streamlined bit better and they could have made both acts for each world happen in row rather than having you go through every world twice outside of that this is particularly special game which is certainly something never thought d say about mfin game where bunch of edgy cloaked dudes and mickey mouse share the same screen space ,1

ust walking through hallways which felt like padding it seems like while the game concept was really cool there really wasn a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game the next portal like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off that being said portal is really high bar so not reaching that expectation does not bad game make since this game is still definitely worth playing imo the story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics which was cool all in all it didn disappoint and would recommend giving it play up there with the portal series as one of the best puzzle games for me m not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one thing like portals or in this case perspective means that it not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do each puzzle is really cool obviously the use of perspective to fiddle with ob,1

the persona series along with its parent series shin megami tensai have generally been consistent with their themes throughout the years the collective unconscious the masks that people wear to conceal their true selves and references to ancient greek and japanese mythology are all motifs that are usually present in smt and persona games this has led to consistently murky tone throughout the series in the undertones when not overtly while the darkest game in the series is up for debate there no debating which is the brightest persona 4 released just 2 years after the decidedly grim persona 3 and on the same engine p4 delivers an overall joyful and optimistic tone that helped it stand out not only from its predecessor but from previous persona and smt games as well this may seem counter intuitive as the focus of the story is on finding murder suspect who kills 2 people within hours of the game beginning yet it the moment to moment dialogue the soundtrack even the color palette the yellow theme provides an overall sunny disposition that makes persona 4 not only joyful experience but joy to experience ,0

far cry 4 is an open world first person shooter that found to be mixed bag on one hand the game offers stunning and immersive world with vast open world map that fun to explore the gameplay mechanics are solid and allow for wide variety of playstyles from stealthy takedowns to full on assaults the game weapon customization system is also impressive allowing for lot of creativity in how you approach each encounter ,1

i think that lot of the people saying that this is one of the worst sonic games of all time are kinda overexaggerating things don think this game is as damaging as something like sonic 06 or sonic boom that being said this game is very bare and there are dozens of other sonic games you could and should play instead of this one the only thing that this game does wrong is just not have any substantial level design or challenge so you just breeze through it in like 3 hours without remembering much of it at all the writing is absolutely corny so if you like that kind of thing then ur gonna be entertained otherwise this game is just like an empty calorie ,1
banger soundtrack but that it ,0
cara nada nesse jogo funciona gameplay do sonic moderno é legal até eu sinto um pouco de falta de paixão do level design mas são poucas fases agora sobre avatar as fases dele são travadas lentas tediosas repetitivas sério não sinto prazer em jogar com meu próprio personagem nem irei comentar sobre clássico porque seria chover no molhado ,0
this game is so fun n don know if it just because of my own sensibilities or low expectations after years of the internet dogpiling on this game but outside of some control issues this was genuinely good time ,0
if you re fan of boost gameplay this sure is video game ,1
a simple game with simple pixel graphics it a point and click adventure with few puzzles but they are very easy to beat and felt like they didn really add much the story has lot of heart and is the main appeal of the game at first wasn a fan of the two scientists but as the game progressed grew to like them lot and now m looking forward to seeing their story continue in other games ,1

the combat takes some getting used to but the story oh do love the story,1
i ve put like sixty hours in this so far and still have ways to go feel like need breaks from this game sometimes but it still top notch ,1
while the combat is lacking the world and the story will keep me enthralled forever,1
took long time because you know work and life stuff n but man what fucking ride revisiting this game and actually doing everything on the world with the new updates it improved an already above average game felt immersed the whole way through side characters and questlines are the golden eggs of this game in one quest there is literally golden egg lol n still have some problems with the main villain think the msq is the least appealing part of the game despite loving ciri as character n words cannot describe the feeling felt after completing everything in blood and wine and being done with this game definitely one of those games you always have fond memories of and probably will keep returning for it from time to time ,1

solid foundation for the juggernaut that is smash bros today gameplay is fine but lacks content compared to future entires ,0
muito divertido possui mais limpo de entender acompanhar em uma boa parte dos mapas na gameplay porém como se trata do começo da franquia balanceamento a otimização das mecânicas não é muito bom ponto que incomda muito os controles do n64 são horríveis o jogo aidna não faz bom uso do analógico deles ,0
still holds up great even if the controls leave little to be desired plenty of single player content too with board the platforms break the targets and classic mode ,0
smash 64 doesn really have lot of content in it ngl but it still dang fun all things considered and also helped start the wacky nonsense that is the modern smash brothers ip if you bust this out at party there going to be good time though if you are more used to the later smash games you ll probably get bored pretty soon ,0
this website is ridiculous but it ok forgive you,0
would have been the best version of mario 64 if it weren for the controls being utter dog shit ,0
borrowed from my friend couple times never completed but loved it don own myself but consider my time with it notable enough to add here ,1
the controls were so bad that they nearly made me cry at multiple intervals,0
it controls really awkwardly due to only using the dpad on the first ever game made to show off the analogue stick but the 30 additional stars and extra characters make it fine mario 64 dlc ,0
its mario 64 but on nintendo ds which is cool because yeehaw portability bonus content and bonus characters but not as cool because no analog control and weird character switching hat switching shenanigans are at play if you don have nintendo 64 this is fine way to experience mario 64 but if you have the means to play the original id rec that one over this one thru charm and playability alone ,0
a good attempt at making mario 64 for the ds more characters and more options are nice but it comes at the cost of controlling the game with the ds controlls which are not great at all if this game came out little later in the ds life span it could of been great or even better yet the 3ds ,1
the chief and cortana stuff is good the rest of the plot is eh and the forerunner enemies can remember all suck still pretty fun to shoot covenant tho,1
played through the whole campaign for the 100th time and its so short with repetitive scenarios and weak new alien race the cortanna plot is still the strongest and most memorable scene ,0
can remember you darling ,1
i was surprised by how much enjoyed halo 4 given the reviews wasn expecting much from it but still had good time it the most modern feeling game mechanic wise in the master chief collection and the story has fitting conclusion to chief and cortana story arc ,1
rating 8 2 10 great,1
halo 4 as game was game whose badness was dramatically oversold to me by people which doesn mean this game is good its probably the worst halo painfully mediocre shooter with terrible story but don find it completely out of line with the rest of the series which is damming of my opinion of halo as whole halo 4 isn the worst modern shooter but unless you have burning desire to play through the entire franchise like have had its not even remotely close to worth your time ,0
it has combat from arkham and assassins creed climbing from uncharted stealth from every 7th gen third person game you spend half of the time clearing out bandit camps and you play the most ai generated character in all of gaming m sure we all remember that iconic lord of the rings characters name this is game so derivative of every other game around it that it lacks any identity and purpose to exist ,0
monolith is an underrated company fear was an underrated franchise in general although the 3rd kind of fell flat luckily they managed to claim some of the respect they were due with this game ,0
a jogabilidade é muito boa jogo tem um sistema de combate bem dinâmico com muitos movimentos habilidades que você pode aprender ao longo do jogo além disso jogo tem sistema nêmesis onde os inimigos que você enfrenta vão se lembrar de você evoluir de acordo com suas ações para mim é ponto alto do jogo ,0
honestly not even that good of game but had blast with the nemesis system and enjoyed doing mindless treasure hunting repetitive missions just because liked making uruks feel as much pain as possible would recommend to family and friends ,1
it assassin creed in middle earth what not to love n the nemesis system is still to this day one of the coolest things ve ever seen in video game and it a shame that wb has done nothing with it since n n disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 8 years ago ,0
manswine,1
mega man 2 basically took everything good about the first game polished it and improved it in every way imaginable with more refined controls less slippery platforming much better stage design iconic boss fights that provide decent challenge more variety in the obtainable powers and improved difficulty balancing alongside another incredible banger of soundtrack can totally see why this game gets the well deserved praise that it gets legitimately fun game that could totally see myself playing more in the future whereas never want to touch the first mega man ever again ,1
without single doubt superior to the first game this is the true seminal episode includes everything that other mega man games will do level design is great challenge is present boss fights are hard enough ,0
this is really where mega man started it has everything going for it too firstly pleasing and charming graphics in spite of nes limitations secondly the soundtrack is phenomenal not just back then but now best nes soundtrack easily and it isn close the levels are very engaging hitting sweet spot of tough but fair the metal blade invalidates lot of enemies but man it fun to use in my review of n super mario bros 3 n mentioned that it was contender for one of the best nes games and holds up in modern times n mega man 2 n was the most poignant example in my mind that stopped me from definitively saying the best ,1
way better level design and difficulty than 1 the robot masters are iconic it has some super banging music and the weapons are overall an improvement in usability and variety truly classic and one of the downright coolest mega man games,1
mega man 2 is an nes game where nowadays you can actually finish the game on first playthrough without using save states or banging your head on wall due to how difficult it is megaman 2 is very balanced game with very good platforming and levels it fixes the issues of mega man 1 which aren many aside from not being janky and difficult as the 1st game this is officially one of my favorite nes games and heavily recommend playing it if you want to get into the mega man franchise,0
if you are familiar with the mega man series or nes games in general you would know that this is without doubt the most popular and beloved game in the entire franchise and one of the greatest nes games ever made while wouldn go as far to say that this game is the best in the entire series it is fantastic improvement from the previous and definitely one of the best nes games ever made ,1
first game 4 5 5 n second game 4 5 5 5 off for the circus one but still has 2 of my fav cases n third game 5 5,1
i actually played these games on mobile but the only option is 3ds you can definitely tell why this series has lasted so long it got solid concept that it tends to execute pretty well admittedly though actually dislike the second game because don enjoy any of the cases first and third are great though ,1
collection of the first 3 ace attorney games the versions of the games in this collection have uniquely upscaled redrawn art assets which might not be to some fans taste but it was fine for me no cool bonus compilation content this is pretty much just bundle of 3 games this is basically the easiest way to get into the ace attorney series considering the fact that this compilation is on like actually everything these days ,1
the games were so fun to play through but do have to say after while it became unclear what direction the cases even would go and wasn really sure what was gonna happen next ,0
for when these games came out they re pretty good although it felt kinda tedious gathering clues and some of the answers honestly kinda stupid n enjoyed it quite lot before leaving it plan on picking it up again one day tho,1
one of the first games that was given for my playstation 4 was physical copy of n infamous second son n but because my console disc drive got clogged up with dust at one point wasn able to play it or any other physical ps4 game for that matter for years now that finally got that fixed started playing through this game shortly after beating n grand theft auto vice city n and while wouldn consider this to be terrible game wouldn exactly say that liked it n infamous second son n is one of the most aggressively milquetoast games ve ever played as almost everything about it feels designed to be just competent enough to keep the player from switching the game off without actually being all that noteworthy the generic visual style and music really didn help with this as it just made the game generally feel much more bland and flavorless like lot of these kinds of games n infamous second son n focuses on the player having to fight yet another force of tyranny and every plot point and character relationship within that journey is as predictable as they can be none of the characters were very interesting but my least favorite was easily the protagonist because on top of the obviously bad idea of making him be part of fictional native american tribe delsin rowe was also just annoying as his constant quips and one liners consistently got on my nerves ,0
this game is what validated my ps4 back when it came out visually it still looks great with lot of good lighting and particle effects either that or m still just easy to please the plot is pretty cool too as you play as some rebel dude tryin to overthrow the authority with his elemental powers as your character can steal elemental powers from other people there a lot of different abilities you can use and can switch from element to element on the fly so that cool there are also moments where you hold the dualshock 4 controller sideways like spray can to paint stuff and that goes hard love dumb controller gimmicks had good time with this one ,0
any game with protagonist that can shoot stuff out of his hands and is voiced by troy baker is getting good score from me the karma system isn used as good as in the originals but this game still looks and plays fantastic ,1
woosh ,1
i get why lot of people love this game but fundamentally find that no element of the game is good enough to compel me to finish it,1
star wars peak fiction the story is insanely good the combat well good enough imo the designs the immersion and the customising you re able to do is very good you could easily spend life time in this game and still discover more stuff ,1
old review but thought d share ,0
this is my favourite game of all time absolute masterpiece and shall take and cherish these moments for the rest of my life,1
fuck taris ,0
i don understand why liked it so much but did so much pure fun,1
good as the first one,1
no more heroes 2 is more of the first game but now with more climatic fights and less filler this game completely removes the overworld in between fights although don like these minigames as much as the first game it loses bit of personality in that sense ,0
abandoned again all on his own n what were the climbs worth n even to struggle as humans yet still ,0
e the no more hero no more heroes 2 is one of those sequels that is for better and worse ,1

i going to be honest don understand japanese but yeah this game is great just going by the opening hopefully we ll get the remake this year hahahahahah ,1
fucked up game makes you walk and you cope,0
wow spinoff,1
heard they re making video games be good now,1
katamari damacy ia just pure fun once you learn the controls it literally picking up objects as you increase in size so do your pickups racing against time limit is somehow relaxing just sucking up the world with ease ,1
i don have much to say about this game that hasn been repeated for the past almost 20 years it easily one of the best titles on the ps2 maybe one of the greatest games ever made the visuals make me laugh and the music makes me cry the simple concept is just so much fun to play with ,1
honestly one of the textbook examples of what video games can be aesthetically incredible with both the artstyle and soundtrack being sensory feast the gameplay loop is addictive and the controls make it easy to learn but hard to master conceptually it incredibly easy to grasp as your ball starts small and you need to roll things up to be bigger the runtime is perfect length where it neither over nor understays its welcome and there enough challenge stages with hard goals to keep the more hardcore players invested both stylistically and functionally this game rocks and it is must play ,1
all best must have original,1
even as kid could tell this wasn a good game ,1
its basically if you took sonic heroes and ratchet and clank and threw them together but removed all the good parts from each of them plot made no sense and getting to the true ending feels like you are playing the video game version of the endless eight the writing is really funny due to how hard it tries to be edgy but you probably already knew that this game is definitely worth watching the cutscenes for or maybe even doing one of the routes in but going for that final boss or if you are really masochist going for 100 all route variation completion just ain worth it fam damn ,0
this game was one of my favorites growing up but now cannot say the same it is still the best sonic game from that era definitely is but those sonic games kind of suck lot really don like how clunky the gameplay is overall don think liked the gameplay even when was young just thought shadow was cool as heck but that gameplay is super clunky and even if it is an improvement over the other sonic games from this era that doesn mean it is good ,1
too easy but still really fun and beautiful ,1
this game goes through essentially the same story set up three times and was ready to quit the game after the second time through still the mechanics are fun mostly and the art and visuals are great the game is just way too long ,0
never made it past the first few hours of this want to like it because of the art but theres so much boring dialog with the slowest text speed ever created by mankind and repetitive enemy encounters with very shallow combat appreciate what it does but think after point just have to accept m not having fun especially since ive heard its over 60 hours long dont think could trudge through the more boring parts to get to the good parts ,0
we love good comeback,1
liked this better than zero mission its fun game and like all the movement,1
overall great game only have couple of complaints the metroid hunting makes the game little too linear and the remake makes the areas of the game feel circular in design the boss fights are way too tanky and some feel like they drag on forever my final complaint is regard to ridley surprise appearance as the final boss love ridley as much as the next guy but ridley sudden appearance doesn really fit the tone and atmosphere of the game it a cool and fun boss fight but it should have ended with the queen metroid like in the original ,0
another fun metroid game it got great map design item placement and enemy variety while the art design doesnt pop as much as others the level design makes up for it ,1
this has everything loved about dread without the annoying emmi segments ,0
as my first life is strange game enjoyed it ve always had soft spot for these kinds of games ,1
didn like the characters and the dialogues that were kinda cringe the entire time played this game haven finished it but really don feel like doing so the town was kinda nicely designed and the visuals are quite pretty with the watercolor ish artstyle alex power was rather annoying and wasn really that cool ,1
entrega tudo que promete mais um pouco gráfico é excepcional plot é envolvente demais eu nem consigo dizer quanto eu amei soundtrack alex é uma mini querida se não fosse sean a chloe ela seria minha fav de toda franquia motivo de eu ter tirando uma estrela foi por conta daquela criança encapetada filho da namorada do gabe que estragou tudo esse menino é mal do mundo gente que ódio era só ele ter aquietado rabo em casa que nada daquilo teria acontecido ,0
it is the best one music fights story pokemon it a gg,1
what can say the best pokemon game and you get to play it second time in the form of sequel ,1
the most single pokemon game has ever had to offer ,0
pokemon black 2 like white 2 is the only time in the entire franchise they made sequel to mainline game and would argue this is the best pokemon has ever had to offer ,0
one of my favorite games it a simulator like princess maker where you manage the live of streamer girl there many endings depending on your efforts ,0
wacky and fun little game just not my cup of tea it interesting for the first few moments but then it becomes kinda trial and error to figure out all the endings honestly got tired of the gameplay loop not too deep into the game and also lost some of the attachment to the setting of the game even so can see how interesting it can be to have all these possibilities that can lead to unique story paths and find out the crazy endings you can get ,0
this is my joker,0
she just like me fr,1
idk why this game is so popular tbh,1
dated but fun roland going critical bitch had me chuckling few times,0
janky brown and dull at times but it will always hold special place in my heart ,0
 played before 2023 n thinking about it don like the game as much as thought did pandora is seen as boring desert with nothing interesting the psychos were cool but the only unique enemies outside of the dlc guns were okay but not nearly as unique in sequels and the characters just weren interesting think the ones you play as are cool but their skill trees are awfully simply and that makes them feel pretty boring until you get to max level which requires three playthroughs yay think the sequels are lot better ,0
hollow knight simplesmente é maravilhoso prova que jogos indies são feitos com muito mais amor doque aaa é isso que me fez apaixonar por esse jogo,0
 the dynamics of design verisimilitude and anachronism in the video game ,1
night critical examination of cacophony and sanctimony in achieving narrative dynamism it pretty much the best video game ever made real souls like review copied from gametrack,0
this game was genuinely just great experience the platforming segments are great and for the most part are really well designed though some areas not so much love the 2 5d style and how the levels bend and intersect it creates quite unique aesthetic that love n the game overall while challenging at times very rarely gets annoying or frustrating which m very happy with and honestly d say solid 70ish percent of the game had no difficulty at all found some of the late game bosses to be some of my favorite parts of the entire game really love the puzzles as well yet again they re really well designed n think the only issue had and this isn even necessarily an issue with the game is that had bad depth perception so sometimes can really tell how far away thing is if it not on the same plane as klonoa but aside from that this game was an absolute blast to play and its ending is definitely worth it ,0
a mountain of classic 90s charm smooths over some minor flaws in the moment to moment platforming in the tradition of all the best side scrollers your set of abilities is narrow but they are perfectly defined taught and explored to their limits by game end also manages to be forgiving without being easy good stuff ,1
i know this game has lot of reviews already on this site but this was very great game so why not klonoa has always one of those series ve been meaning to try more of but before talk about the game thought d share my history with the series ,1
sensational,1
this was fun time till after 3 2 where levels started to be little bullshit at moments the rings grab is little to short and the bosses are very generic still had fun time just hope 2 is better ,1
really pretty world and combat addictive and fun,1
it started of strong with the world collapsing around lara but after finishing the game had mixed feelings the parkour is significantly better than rise but everything else was meh ,1
its fine but the weakest of the triology especially the story and the writing was weak ,0
fine,1
its been 10 years and never beat that carrot mini game fuck this game ,0
fuck the carrot eating minigame,0
good as fuck liked this shit so much finished fast as fuck peak mario rpg for now didnt played all of then the music is so fucking good dude its creative as hell its just very good game ,0
this game would ve been pure kino if it was mario and bowser teaming up instead of cool bowser sections interspliced with the kind of bland sections with vored mario and luigi,0
the best mario and luigi game and one of the best mario rpgs period an ultra charming story coupled with tight and unique gameplay that utilizes the ds in creative ways although it is the titles motiff and very fun to play as bowser hes too prominent in the first half relegating the mario bros to second fiddle the balance gets much better in the second half with only few slight complaints in level design inside bowser story is near perfect game the best ds title have played ,1
it exactly what you expect it to be and love that about it ,1
utterly devoid of ideas beyond the cyberpunk horizon this game does everything you could expect from the genre the only salvation is its fluid gameplay you could not make game more cyberpunk than this and that a bad thing ,0
played on pc with rx 480 graphics card n also available on ps4 ps5 xbox one xbox series series and nintendo switch,0
beat my ass 10x over thanks for asking,1
at basic level this is better game than the original watch dogs but at the same time feel like there is fundamental inability to address the ways in which the game breaks down when putting gameplay and narrative together as well as bringing the game down with the usual ubisoft map collectathon,1
explore massive open world except don because it really boring,0
haha funni 2016 world game n san francisco atleast is cool but apart should revisit also missions being replay able is better thing than the previous game ,1
such fascinating experiment they jumped through ton of hoops to make this story possible and to ensure everything fit together but was left wondering why ,1
i commander shepard and this is my favorite game on the citadel ,1
multiplayer underrated ,0
 played before 2023 n remember when this came out hearing about the problems it had the story choices the ending some of the decisions and such but playing it now all these years later with all the dlc think it is amazing loved the combat loved seeing my cast of friends and all my actions add up loved how they expanded upon the reapers and the citadel dlc was wow after binging 150 200 hours in mass effect 1 and 2 plus more of mass effect 3 playing this dlc was special being with all the companions had finally relaxed and seeing them happily talk to each other remembering those that were lost that what think about when hear the term mass effect the companions best ones out there and didn love the ending but was happy with how it wrapped up and think that it was good way to complete the series because it seems like they either wrote themselves in corner or they might ve had another idea planned that got changed for whatever reason ,1
finally they gave female shepard an option for freckles for real though we all know this game story wasn what it could have been you can really feel the developers rushing to get the story to an ending of some kind ,0
a really good game with disappointing ending arguably the best gameplay in the series and you ,0

it fun to explore and stuff and the civil war quests are super fun that it this game is bad why do people like it so much also woman sent me nudes while was playing this for the first time still almost fell asleep while playing ,1
i never played skyrim for more than an hour before 2022 turns out it very fun after all ,1
inside the mind of trump voter,1
far cry 3 dlc,0
i redownloaded the game on ps5 since they recently added an update that adds 60fps to new gen consoles and still have the same exact gripes had with it the last time played in that the core gameplay is actually very fun but the missions are okay at best and slog at worst which gets even worse when the game forces you to play story missions by having squad come out of nowhere and kidnap you and you weren prepared at all the dlcs are all not worth buying except maybe the vietnam one just for the weapons you can use ingame which make more sense to be in the game than some of the strange choices floating around in the base game also the story is really dumb and the twist ending while ballsy to do in big aaa title makes the whole game story pointless and paints the big evil cult that kidnaps and brainwashes and tortures people completely in the right the only thing could recommend for this game is the arcade mode which has wonderful in depth custom map editor which gives you lot of freedom and even has various assets from other ubisoft titles that you can play with which all of that results in one of the best custom map features ever put in modern aaa title which is why for some weird ass reason it wasn in fc6 okay ,0
kind of chore boring villain ,0
fun enough play it with friend ,1
super overhated,0
again xbox 360 was really fun,1

only fun when im in the mood,1
wdym my top plays don count just because they were sotarks maps,1
amazing dungeons good atmosphere and fine pacing in the latter half of the game always entices me for another playthrough but then m usually put off remembering the game that you are forced to play through before the third dungeon it still took nintendo two mainline titles after this one to realize that what zelda formula needed wasn constant stepping on the brakes for obligatory exposition the weakest part of the series ,0
this is my favorite zelda,1
ugly with mostly forgettable or bad boss encounters and dungeons that feel like chore the weirdest part is how tossed off the main gimmick of the game is being wolf is never particularly fun and cleansing the world of the twilight realm is hilariously underwhelming you hunt some bugs ,0
amazing dungeons the best companion epic story make this the best classic 3d zelda game wolf segments can annoy some players tho and beginning drags on on repreated playthrough ,0
beating orphan of kos means can do anything,0
hardest bosses in the entire souls genre and new hunter weapons makes this probably the best from software dlc ,1
an amazing extension of one of the greatest games of all time simply put just pure fun ,1
this has to be the best dlc to accompany souls game and perhaps one of the best pieces of dlc ever made in my mind the old hunters and the base game of bloodborne feels inseparable and when rating this im giving both of them 5 don feel like can say much more that hasn been said but bloodborne feels like once in lifetime masterpiece and the old hunters only bolsters it,1
without this piece bloodborne itself couldn exist and couldn fulfill its design to the utmost n an astonishing fact that this short dlc contains so much content including the best bosses which fits to the battle system really well enemies profound map with calculated connection between locations and of course fantastic soundtrack that surpasses an original ost in some way ,1
my eyes hurt,0
hab kürzlich meine erste route scarlet blaze edelgard my love abgeschlossen overall bietet es das übliche warriors gameplay mit einem echt guten mix an three houses mechanics hat mir gefallen die story ist dazu ne schöne lore extension zu three houses ,0
i sung mighty praise on the first fe warriors so it makes sense that would play the second one and oh boy did ,1
birthed off the far inferior origin game of fire emblem three houses koei once again decided to develop warriors game for fire emblem this time as spinoff and sequel to the game that they did over half the work on the core difference here is how vastly superior the gameplay is over its predecessor fire emblem warriors there just more variety in the choices you can make and they actually tried to implement more fire emblem mechanics into the gameplay considering there are many more characters ,0
better than the first mistake fe warriors finished all routes except for black eagles cuz just got lazy and needed to return the game anyways love that gatekeeper is playable lol,0
the 3ds stick is already flimsy and playing smash on it for more than week is guaranteed to destroy that thing ,0
i bought 2ds for you you lose points for that you little munchkin you ,0
better than wii u,1
boring need someone to play local or it turns to be tedious game n 3,0
definitely held everyone over until the wii version came out few months later it certainly is portable smash 4 the fact that this thing can run on this system at all is really impressive ngl and the game plays just as well as any other smash this game was certainly good way to kill time back in high school as people always had this game so game rooms were everywhere smash run was also banger gamemode now that ultimate has been out forever theres not really lot of reason to go back to this as portable smash but for its time it was very cool,1
peak peak peak peak peak have no words just peak at that time completed this game and it became my favorite game of this series it was just purely peak from start to finish lloyd bannings was him he just that fucking guy this game was the game that showed me this series is something like ve never experienced before in any sort of media this was truly peak fiction also played the geofront patch ,1
jesse play the azure arbitrator even if we scare the hoes,0
great sequel to zero with some of the best story and character writing so far that being said d still think zero handles its characters better and some of the twist especially during the final stretch of the game may seem out of nowhere if you didn do spesific side quest or bonding with them which brings my biggest problem with this game that is bonding event locking character important backstory and development behind optional event is bad decision still d think what was there was good really good even but it could ve been more than just optional event tbh trails to azure is great game and must play for jrpg fans should check out if they like zero and most importantly trails in general ,0
played the geofront patch before the official release ,1
so so so good,1
a solid follow up to trails from zero the story goes way off the rails near the end and some lategame twists come out of nowhere if you don do the sidequests that foreshadow them you can also see some of the tropes that cold steel would become infamous for start to rear their head here ,0
i have many memories of this game none of them are of me beating it but they re all still happy ,1
super mario rpg n is such stellar video game much like n donkey kong country n the cg graphics have miraculously aged well and d argue even better than that series thanks to the cartoony and vibrant expressions the characters make ,1
mario rpg is dang good first attempt to kick off the long line of mario rpg it got an incredibly charming presentation with very fun characters and writing goofy plot with lot of memorable moments and fun soundtrack all of that stuff is consistently really good ,1
ich verstehe bis heute nicht weshalb nintendo dieses spiel damals nicht nach europa gebracht hat das snes war auch hierzulande die rpg maschine schlechthin und dieses spiel ist der perfekte einstieg für neulinge des genres und nicht zuletzt sind mario und co hauptprotagonisten die auch damals schon absolut jeder kannte n ich habe es später dann erst über einen emulator gespielt mittlerweile 2x sicherlich es ist nicht perfekt aber mich hat es voll abgeholt die gewählte perspektive wirkte auf screenshots sehr interessant nicht zuletzt auch weil mit mario 64 schon klar war wo die reise hingehen würde somit wurde mit etwas pseudo 3d auf dem snes hier schön gespielt gameplaytechnisch stand die perspektive dann zwar durchaus ein paar mal im weg aber das hat mich jetzt nicht sonderlich gestört ,0
me esperaba un combate mucho más profundo complejo difícil no ha sido para tanto una cosa que me molesta de estos juegos donde hay un boton de esquivar si le das eres inmune aunque el ataque te haya dado de lleno n la historia esta bien pero la manera en como solucionas las cosas es liandote de ostias con todo el mundo n hay una materia que esta absorbiendo la humanidad la manera en la que limpias la tierra de eso es pegándole todo el mundo n también noto que la historia esta apresurada n cuando entras en la zona 09 te encuentras un pavo que mola mil que tiene pensado rebelarse contra los gobernantes pero después de ese episodio no vuelve aparecer n la tía malvada nunca deja claro que por qué esta creando tanto monstruos salvo para destruir al malo n lo mismo le pasa al malo final que su plan es absorber todo para que él absorba ese recipiente convertirse en dios pero habla de que asi la humanidad alcanzará un nuevo nivel cuando el único que evoluciona es él ya que los demás son absorbidos n ni la historia ni la jugabilidad es algo destacable se aleja de la gran obra de platinum game que la gente me ha vendido pero aun así es un juego disfrutable con un gran apartado artístico tanto en lo visual como en su maravillosa banda sonora ,0
god made me buy this video game know it was god and not satan because did not enjoy playing this game at all ,1
ever since this game was announced it been in the back of my mind it got lot of attention at release with lot of people review bombing it because of its switch exclusivity for some reason it even weirder because no one talks about this game nowadays ironically think it being an exclusive kind of brought more people to it it certainly stands out when next to mario and zelda and most other switch exclusives regardless is the game good ,0
shitpost game that flew under everyone radar it very cool when it wants to be but it also very dumb ,0
takes place in an anime fantasy world where cops are good and also have jojo stands astral chain my beloved,1
in 2019 platinum games was coming off their biggest hit yet nier automata was adored by fans and critics alike and expectations were high for their next project so naturally nintendo fans who missed out on nier were excited when in early 2019 console exclusive developed by platinum games called astral chain was announced for the switch while critically praised upon release this game unfortunately ended up feeling like more of step back than step forward for the developer ,1
dmc devil may cry é um jogo bem sólido com uma das melhores gameplays da série as melhores mais divertidas seções de plataforma gameplay é muito boa com muitos combos fluidos variedade da armas como parte fundamental dessa estrutura troca rápida de armas durante um combo porém mesmo sendo um game muito gostoso de jogar os inimigos não acompanham essa fluidez toda acabam sendo na esmagadora maioria do jogo apenas sacos de pancadas de combos que abaixa muito dificuldade do game que pode desagradar alguns incluindo eu no geral embora conte com um ou outro inimigo interessante no geral os inimigos não tem metade do carisma da série principal que tbm se reflete um pouco nos poucos chefes do game na qual dois em especial são bem criativos legais porém os outros não tem mesmo tempero que série clássica quanto história aoesar de um reboot dá pra perceber cuidado de contar uma história de início mais consistente uniforme diferente da série principal que é uma bagunça tremenda na questão do enredo cronologia história do jogo funciona passando um ar demoníaco mais sujo pé no chão do que padrão anime da série original que nesse jogo caiu muito bem porém acredito que maior responsável pelo rage que esse jogo sofreu seja seu protagonista dante que não tem 20 do carisma do protagonista original somada péssima estratégia de marketing usada na promoção desse jogo na época apenas reforçaram aversão ao personagem que infelizmente se refletiu na repercussão do game porém infelizmente fico curioso pra saber quais seriam os rumos da história partir desse game os quais eram promissores n no geral se você gosta do gênero hack slash deseja uma experiência extremamente gostosa de jogar você vai gostar de dmc devil may cry ,0
 played before 2023 n good music fun to kill demons that somes up all the positives hate dante new design hate the teleported into demon world because it makes every level feel exactly the same and the platforming wasn that interesting this was the first dmc game played and probably why ve never really gotten into the series ,0
install an el donte spanish sombrero dante mod for this shit and play it with friend the gameplay and music will go genuinely hard while the story will provide you tons of laughs with how utterly mediocre it is ,0

he cast is great and they all bounce off each other incredibly well it always treat seeing how each will react to different choices on new playthroughs n if there one thing that really does suck about the game is the lack of support this game gets from ea definitely think it needs remaster way more than mass effect ever did d also argue that while most of the key characters looked good at launch most of the npcs looked pretty rough,1
unning on this game to make it look good on mode,1
mpire where it totally unplayable without fixes but it not exactly the best impression if you just play vanilla we ll probably get remaster someday just hope they don sand all the edges down in the process though n anyways dao is an amazing game ve played way too many times and can wait to play many more times realistically its like 4 or 4 5 because the gameplay and combat feels really outdated and some quest areas are unnecessarily long but the companions villains and quest are all peak so idgaf,1
great game wonderfully told story with easily the best graphics on the platform this alone warrants perfect score ,1
pretty game decent story but fuck me it a chore dealing with the menus of this game super slow average combat meh at best ,1
to my mind the most beautiful ps1 game and triumph in character and environment design even now when you go back watching the cinematics from this game makes it feel so stylish and modern just phenomenal job from an art perspective also like playing it just have less to say about that ,1
squaresoft was absolutely dominating the rpg genre at the turn of the millennium final fantasy chrono cross and legend of mana are just few examples of the types of games which were experiencing their heyday in the late 5th generation they dabbled in the action rpg subgenre before but with the release of vagrant story in 2000 the action aspect was amplified and the rpg aspect was significantly toned down players expecting similar experience to previously mentioned games would be in for big surprise as this title lacked all the tropes you would expect in typical rpg no levels no parties no item shops no grinding vagrant story ,0
ain appeal at the ti,1
pgs were expected to be it no doubt that vs offers quite the unique experience whether that a good thing or not though is up for debate ,0
i haven beaten the game but do want to just have like 7 other games on my plate right now and am in fact choking on all of them instead of managing my time properly and playing one at time,1
good horror game,1
classic shit managing your resources made not only the monsters but also yourself into an enemy sound design is great monster design is good even though theres only like 2 and the story is fine but only really matters for the first and the last 10 minutes of the game plenty of monsters in awkward spots to scare you which is appreciated biggest issue is wish the environments had more variety it starts to feel monotonous as you progress,0

to review monster hunter rise sunbreak is difficult because as game there is always something that could be improved but what we got was still one of the best multiplayer experiences possible on the nintendo switch and just huge advancement on the original game sunbreak adds whole new tone to the adventure and easily nearly another hundred hours of gameplay within that is still being updated today can deny that this game is so addictive that you will find it hard to stop so many addictive gameplay elements new monsters who have incredible new designs locales that are just super fun and questline that feels more gothic and engaging to its tone sunbreak was the best expansion could have imagined rise to get and cannot wait to see where the franchise goes next ,0
raw fun,1
personally my fav monster hunter game it very newbie friendly ,1
sunbreak is an incredible expansion to monster hunter rise that fixes lot of problems so many amazing monsters are brought back that we haven seen in while and are reworked to make them even better than before sunbreak also fixes lot of difficulty problems that rise had it still not incredibly hard but there are plenty of tough fights if you re looking for one there are so many awesome armor loadouts and build customization this game is just better than rise in every way which is to be expected from monster hunter rank expansion,0
favorite part hunting with the sv squad 3,1
excellent expansion love all the new and returning monsters the three lords are super fun to fight and as someone whose favorite mh game is gu was delighted to see that much of the roster from that game came back all of them with revamped moveset that increased the difficulty of their fights but at the same time made them more engaging this is massive improvement over the base game which left me very unsatisfied very similar to how felt with base world and iceborne ,1
infinite mario levels is dream come true but unfortunately most of them are made by little timmy and his dirty diaper started leaking all over the switch transforming little timmys diahreeha into mario level ,0
this game is tragic because it should be 5 it an improvement from the og in almost every way the new content added including the very tasty ability to built an entire narrative out of set of levels should make this game no brainer purchase and it is buy it it great n but the magic is gone the level designer was just first and foremost perfect fit for the wii gamepad so no matter how many super bells and whistles and links are added can help but feel an empty feeling in my gut when play this one ,1
story mode not only was kinda boring but also took away all the ideas for levels that already had so havent been able to really think of anything creative yet doesn help that the actual level editor is lot harder to use now that it designed for controller instead of the gamepad multiplayer online is an absolute wash despite being the perfect idea ever thanks to horrible netcode kinda dropped off from this one and never picked it up again even after bunch of seemingly interesting updates they really did drop the ball on making an online mario game with infinite content huh ,0
the first fe game ever played but not beat have nostalgic memories of pulling out my phone in class and just playing chapter or two really fun times,1
fire emblem 7 n is my personal favorite video game ever made ,1
i am doing this review on memory alone as it has been 3ish years since have last played it yet another good fire emblem game ,0
after playing lot of other lego games this one just felt like another one of those nothing special nothing memorable we quit about 1 3 of the way into the game because we got bored there are far better lego games than this one n n disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 8 years ago ,0
i think this game got me to stop playing lego games ,1
awesome open world lego game ,1
i don really remember much other then deadpool did silly deadpool things,0
recomendado aunque peca de usar mucho el 2d ,1
in my short review of sonic robo blast 2 mentioned how didn really enjoy sonic that much and how that game was the most fun had with anything sonic related ,1
theres some weird levels that arent fast at all but most of the levels are pretty good like the aesthetic the graphics and the music slaps as always its super short tho even for my liking good game tho even when the boost trilogy is at its worst its just meh,1
i think the writing is actually all right not very good but it could certainly be lot worse as for the game itself it somehow feels both too long and too short at the same time the wisps are neat idea and they re fairly fun in execution and the music for aquarium park is great the bosses are kind of aggressively mediocre aside from the last one though ,1
sonic colors is bit of an odd game at the time this was the video game that sonic fans desperately needed after critics slammed unleashed and black knight and people seemed to be pretty happy with this one when it came out myself included however have realized that don really come back to this one as often as do with other sonic games and always wondered why that is the level themes are all very unique the soundtrack is great and the gameplay is the boost formula we all know and love so why is it that this game didn stick with me the way most other sonic games didn i guess while the gameplay is cool most of the level design revolves around controlling sonic in 2d space and ve always been more of fan of the 3d setpieces sonic runs around instead of the 2d segments in modern sonic levels that being said this game is still very solid so don think you should sleep on it especially if you like sonic just sits in very weird personal purgatory of mine ,1
pokemon honestly been going downhill since and it feels more like an obligated series per nintendo console rather than something gamefreak actually wants to make the story was decent and the pokemon were alright but think this is where my interest in pokemon started dying down,0
i don remember this game very much but had little figure of the legendary pokémon that came with the game,1
would probably be the best pre switch pokemon game to actually play through if it wasn bogged down worse than ever by truckload of exposition for plot small children yawn at ,0
it a good game would be shame if they released the same game but with more stuff like year later,1
i don think we ll ever get pokemon gen better than this one peak creatures peak region solid character roster great fashion options peak music peak anime and of course peak games as well and them immaculate 3ds vibes help too,1
another massive adventure that is often looked down due to its difference and excruciating difficulty it however is great game with lots of ideas and expands greatly on the original zelda lore ,0
i had lot of fun with this one sure the game can be bit punishing on game over and the grind to level up is real but honestly was enjoying myself playing this more often than wasn i enjoyed the sidescrolling platforming and also enjoyed the rpg elements thrown in the secrets also were somewhat obtuse but not as bad as the first game imo still guide game there no way you are gonna comfortably clear this blind this is definitely the black sheep in the series given the fact that no zelda game like it was ever made since but think people are bit overly harsh on it ,1
couldn get into it long since surpassed by newer games ,0
eally gonna change much to be fai,0
eels tedious even with the cheat code version that nintendo put up on nso then you messed up somewhere think i,0

this is clear example of less is sometimes more battlefield 4 is an unbalanced mess of game compared to 3 the scale is impressive but at the cost of player experience its not worth it ,1
really bad campaign,0
i hate hate hate hate hate vehicle players but it battlefield and playing on normal tdm servers is even more of hectic mess n this game 8 9 years ago 4 stars and pretty dang awesome n this game nowadays on steam servers kinda rough and sweaty and players are annoying so ll generously rate it 3 stars and call it day,0
my personal favorite battlefield game absolutely love the multiplayer in this game the servers are still relatively active even compared to some of their more recent releases battlefield 1 m sure battlefield hardline falls into this same boat would highly recommend giving this game multiplayer shot if you have not done so already ,1
the only thing remember about this game is that it had michael kenneth williams for some reason don even know why own it m pretty sure played like 2 hours of the campaign and never touched the multiplayer ,1
played this through again due to bt4 getting announced and man it really is just the best dbz game it absurd in it scaling the wackiest characters like appule and devilman are represented and by god is the ai chaotic sometimes but still can get enough of it ,0

holy fucking shit,0
um dos melhores jogos de luta já feitos conhecido por quebrar muitos controles por ai até hoje me impressiona como esse ainda é jogo de dragon ball mais fiel ao anime mesmo em 2023 combate é veloz combar é fácil mas muito divertido tem uma câmera maneira tem uma quantidade imensa de personagens o número só aumenta se você contar com as transformações já que moveset muda sempre que algum personagem se transforma jogo envelheceu bem recomendo muito por favor não nos decepcione budokai tenkaichi 4 ,1
a very fresh take on the series after gold cemented itself as the ultimate compilation the team found itself in need of new ideas think they did great job at it n the decision to make the characters control in such varied and unconventional ways is brilliant after all the series is at it best when the break neck excercise of going from minigame to minigame enters strange zen of decision making mixed with speed and rythm the charming characters adding deliciously to this recipe suddenly challenging minigame is matter of not only reacting and being familiar with it but of assesing how your character can approach the situation and how to use these tools for quick jolts of self expression and efficiency n while it hard to beat the party atmosphere of smooth moves the absolute banquette of content that is gold or the simple stroke of genius of the original this title prooves itself worthy of being up there in the pantheon of clever and elegant game design that is the wario ware series ,0
the campaign is bit too short but very repayable as always n the multiple character mechanic completely freshens uo the formula n if you wanted game with more meat on its bones would still recommend gold over this one but not everyone has 3ds n that penny song is banger tho,1
good fun but just not the gamecube original,1
if this is the last warioware game made what low note to end it on even playing co op it wasn that fun and the minigames feel hampered by the all characters gimmick thankfully we will get new rhythm heaven game right rightttttttt ,1
it was good but wish they could ve done something closer to smooth moves,0
stop giving david cage budget feel bad giving this low score solely because my girlfriend liked it ,1
this sucked,0
this is the only game ive ever played that made me feel like sexual predator and dont think thats good thing,1
8 5 ideia extremamente interessante execução magnífica é muito único jeito como narrativa trabalha conceito do jogo por meio da gameplay o character driven da jodie é sensacional ótima qualidade técnica direção fabulosa ,0
could have been better but still fun,1
quite possibly the worst digimon title as well as vn have ever played the plot is all over the place the main cast are just bad anime caricatures and the gameplay is basic as hell take it from me as huge digimon fan do not buy this game ,0
yawner,0
the start of it is so slow and boring it will never beat the allegations still bought it though please keep making more digimon games just ones better than this one thanks,0
i had really good time with this game the story felt just like watching digimon anime and that definitely what wanted out of it the battle system isn much special but played on easy so it just server as way for battles to play out in the story anyway love good digimon story and this delivered ,1
a lot of visual novel here they made it clear with the marketing however the dialogue pacing left me with too much time with my thoughts than to read ,0
depois de um tempo jogando não consegui entrar no jogo não ter uma crise de choro só de escutar trilha sonora ,0
this game was cute it fun to build your ship and harvest the crops and the characters you meet along the way are very sweet the art and color schemes are great after while you end up doing some of the same minigames even with the same rly emotional music lolol which kind of waters down the effect didn quite finish this game but got through most of it think,1
idk what to say about this game but like it,1
wasn for me the aesthetic is very cozy and sweet which isn what went in expecting given the subject matter but found the mini games quickly started feeling more like chores than fun had to kind of force myself to finish the game ,1
coming back to this game over year later to play the dlc was whole new experience gone was the player who once knew how to play this game who had spent hours painstakingly devising the most efficient system of farming every resource gone was the player who carefully memorised her process of elimination method to discover all the new recipes gone was the player who knew where literally anything was ,0
the uncle disappearing made me think it was taking turn and got me to keep playing but then grew plants for like 20 more hours and then died what journey,0
i feel like this is more interesting than the first one liked this one more,1
tv bad or something guess ,0
é pura arte um jogo absurdo que continua alto padrão do primeiro ,0
little nightmares 2 é genial se 1 já era aflitivo esse segundo jogo é de traumatizar gameplay é bem gostosinha história é fantástica vilão é bom pra cacete slenderman agiota o final é de fazer alguém chorar de raiva não porque é ruim sim porque nosso protagonista é traído pela única pessoa que ele confiava tempo todo simplesmente incrível ,0
that ending thooo the music was amazing too ,0
não evolui tanto do primeiro pra esse ambos os jogos sofrem dos exatos mesmos problemas fora isso gostinho que fica dos dois últimos capítulos favorecem sentimento positivo que tenho pelo jogo apesar de não gostar desse design obtuso cada vez mais comum nos jogos ,1

ithin 2 on the other hand is only somewhat successful tweaking of modern game design to fit over what were deemed flaws by critics of the first game hugely disappointing follow up to the original game of course maybe it shouldn have been knowing mikami was replaced as director and the lead concept artist ikumi nakamura was completely absent from this project as well less frustrating than the first game with simpler story and less scary had easily more fun with this one it looks great da uma surra tão bizarra naquela franquia medíocre de re que faz até survival horror parecer bom,0
irei logar isso aqui nunca mais tocar nesse jogo você que está lendo também não deve jogar isso n é pior que droga essa porra aqui viciante pra krl é gostosinho dms ver os balão explodir mas não caia nessa armadilha viciante que é quase impossível de largar,0
good game but it gets unfun as you play it tho ,1
the only td game worth playing tbh ,1
its perfect except its not bloons td 5,1
i loved this game the more time spent with it the more loved it pretty damn perfect,1
better every time ,1
short and sweet good music and gameplay that is easily replayable wish you could play all the areas as big levels but you unlock the whole game as one big level after you beat it ,1
its like playing fucking album cover,0
atmosphere russian rebar ak and jank dialogue sign me up surprisingly fun gun mechanics and resource management combined with its anti war themes retroactively make this ukrainian made game speak to me even if the voice acting is bit poor would recommend russian voice overs with subtitles if you can handle it ,0
ligeramente decepcionado es un juego que aguanta el tipo visualmente de una manera que hasta asombra en un juego con casi una década sus espaldas la ambientación el apartado sonoro son también aspectos destacar pero en los demás en el diseño jugable el diseño de niveles etc se le nota mucho el cartón niveles extremadamente cortos desconectados entre sí al punto de que hay cierta sensación de desconexion de falta de ritmo en la propia historia que propone el juego n en su día aguantaría mejor el tipo sin duda así que quizás sea más culpa mía de mis expectativas que del propio juego ,0
a genuinely beautiful story based on the world of post apocalyptic catastrophe an engaging experience all the way from start to finish that does nice subtle job at morality also great example of how to properly remaster an old game ,1
good,1
cara que jogo incrível eu já conhecia esse jogo há muito tempo sempre ouvi falar sobre quão foda é esse jogo mano eu concordo com essa galera ,0
never let kouma be good character in one of these games,1
started like garbage but got so much better,1
this game is just blast to play with friends its easy enough to pick up and play that you can make n something n happen even if traditional fighting games aren really your speed eternally afraid of playing this game online there are some real good people who play this game online also real godsend that the dlc characters are free really hate picking up game like this only to find out you have to shill out whole other games worth of money to get the whole cast ,1
the first playthrough of elden ring is one of the best eperiences gaming can offer you but after youve explored everything in the open world and you ve experienced all of the surprises you lose motivation to go exploring on repeat playthroughs which takes lot away from the replayability which is very important thing for from games imo ,0
a replay solidified my love for elden ring so easily my favorite game of all time actually beating malenia this time was also an amazing feeling just love being in this world man its the greatest of all time,1
the game is absolutely beautiful with so much to do the replayability is crazy and it never gets old with it too ,0
took everything great about the soulsborne games and make it 100 better ,1
i play with my overlevelled friend every time and we still fail sometimes he on ng6 insanely difficult game lol n gorgeous graphics animations everything about this game is so beautiful deserves all the hype it gets if you have powerful enough pc definitely recommend you play it on there if you use keyboard you ll want to change the keybinds because the defaults are ass ,0
tied as my favorite souls game with bloodborne truly one ll keep coming back too ,1
convinced this is roguelike for people who do not like the genre the art is technically good but the aesthetic does very little for me too clean or something idk wish liked it but do not,1
incredible art banger soundtrack surprisingly charming storyline and big red dog hades has very smooth gameplay but after playing it for while it just feels like youre doing the same 3 hit combo ove and over again which dont get me wrong that combo feels great to do but once becomes muscle memory you kinda go into autopilot also think the boons are cool but would like to see them change the flow of combat bit more there are some cool ones like the grape boon that can change the way you play but most of them are just upgrades that dont really change the gameplay or strategy other then those 2 small gripes the game is fantastic ,1
não sou muito de jogo indie admito que joguei poucos mas devo dizer que hades foi um dos melhores jogos que joguei na vida facilmente no top 15 toda sua arte dublagem gameplay carisma dos personagens é tudo incrivel,0
i can shake the feeling that am thoroughly bored playing hades ve picked up hades three times over the last few years and three times ve found myself putting down the controller after handful of hours especially after reaching the third stage and couldn figure out why it wasn working for me after giving it few good goes ve finally managed to pin down what it is that just doesn click for me about hades ,0
one of my favorites in the rogue likes lites only being beat by binding of isaac love the characters thanatos my beloved and the writing and the art style and rrraaaahhh this game is awesome,1
a really good switch game however didn really grip me like mario odyssey,0
i was very disappointed by the final boss fight but the rest of the game is so good it makes me not want to even do the final boss fight anyway just so can play more of the game do wish that there were more unique mechanics in combat besides just parrying and link flurry rush but the world is really pretty and actually incentivizes exploring it characters are great story is great and makes you work for it and there tons of hidden secrets and details ,1
sencillamente el mejor juego que he tenido el placer de disfrutar esperé 5 años para poder jugarlo puedo decir que valió cada segundo la espera no estoy ni cerca de conseguir el 100 tengo mas de 100 horas aún estoy descubriendo cosas nuevas va más allá de un simple juego es una experiencia que lamentablemente solo se puede vivir una vez en la vida la recomiendo totalmente ,0
em meio tanto jogo de mundo aberto ruim saindo por aí na última década acho que da pra entender porque breath of the wild chocou tanto as pessoas no ano em que ele lançou realmente eu acho que é melhor mundo aberto que eu já joguei até hoje explorar cada pedacinho desse mundo é tão gostoso parece que tudo aqui tá no mapa tem um propósito para estar lá diferente dos mapas vazios da ubisoft por exemplo acho que unico defeito é esses sistema chatinho de durabilidade das armas ficar trocando de arma tempo todo é tão chato espero que no próximo não tenha ,1
soundtrack is tied for 1 with nier automata super charming story and characters which have become iconic and all that made by 1 man thats it thats the review have no criticisms,0
just play this game dont look at any of these reviews just pick the game up and know nothing else about it if you are one of the lucky ones that didnt get spoiled on the game it will fucking break you in the best of ways,0
whooaa ohh ohhhh ohoohhohh ohhwooaah story of undertale,1
a nice unique take on the rpg indie game format by incorporating really good ideas funny interactions an incredibly subtle story and wonderful music definitely must play if you have not already ,1
this games worldbuilding is incredible with its amazing soundtrack and gorgeous art direction it really makes you feel like you re spiderman one of the best value in gaming tbh this game is packed full of content and none of it feels like filler even the boss rush manages to feel fresh by introducing some surprise bosses boss variants as rewards for beating tough pantheons cant wait to play silksong when turn 80 ,1
this isn just game this is an entire experience n was not too much into metroidvania games and then tried this without any expectation it became one of my favorite games of all time and brought me into the genre now m seeking for similar adventures and can wait for silksong n ve done all 112 in my first run and now m beating the game again then ll aim to master the game on steam and this is the first time game instigated me to do that masterpiece ,1
i like how you can bounce on spikes with your nail good casual game that offers additional challenges for people that are socially challenged,1
a rivetting action adventure game with stunning design extremely rewarding but also gruesomly difficult at times ,0
for each individual aspect platforming exploration combat but the integration and packaging of the content are so good it slightly better that the sum of its parts most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful and many evoke that super metroid gleeful feeling that you ll finally be able to access that new area grab that item or beat that boss the end game challenges reminiscent of wiley fortress and boss rushes after megaman has fully self actualized were the highlight boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master found uses for some charms had written off as not my style to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics my only gripes n the repeated backtracking get it fast travel mechanic that too liberal can erase the environment but this was excessive n some of the charms seemed worthless even after strategizing for boss combat and platforming rushes n in the name of decency and civility make geo sucking ability automatic ,1
muito bom vc pode construir usar sua imaginação mods sobreviver jogar multiplayer até zerar jogo minecraft é um jogo incrível fica melhor cada atualização nunca zerei mesmo depois de muitos anos ,0
baby gammeeee n had the most fun playing when it was first released sory n still fun for couple of hours when playing with people tho ,1
the best game ve played in my life,1
omori is game held up by it heartbreaking emotional story and lifelike characters and ultimately let down by lackluster battle mechanics and gimmicky otherworld ,0
i fucking love air conditioning ,0
didnt close my eyes,0
still not finished but loving the game,1
one of my favorite games of all time it definitely has flaws with it ,1
acing god fucking hate sweetheart castle section but the twist and just overall the characters are so likeable and well written like aubrey kel and hero don really care too much about sunny but he alright guess gets the job done feel basil could definitely use some more screentime the guy rarely gets any in the real world section of the game the writing is,1
have only been metroid fan for couple of years but think this was worth the 19 year wait,1
the most unexpected nintendo release of 2021 pretty good offering by mercury steam while some ideas are questionable like these invulnerable bosses that need to be avoided they do add up to the tension the final boss is unforgiving and punishes hard ,0
the best 2d metroid has been the art design in this one pops out so much you ll remember distinct areas for later the abilities are so fast in this one and some puzzles require some strong thinking even knowing where the item locations are ,1
there was nothing dreadful about this game nothing ,0
context sensitive grappling hooks are hatecrime,0
it a solid party game m bad at lying though and it makes me feel bad not complaint with the game it a complaint with myself that makes it harder for me personally to enjoy,0
lie to your friends simulator,0
im carrying the weight of the wooooooooooooooooooorld,1
nier automata is an unforgettable game androids vs machines all while trying to save humanity and uncover the cold truth of this post apocalyptic world 2b and 9s share common goal but have differing views through the story the combat is more fleshed out than its predecessor due to chips and pod mechanics characters change and face reality after meeting characters and concepts never seen before ,0
this is my favorite game ever and the only game cared enough about to get the platinum trophy in might be biased here but the game has lot of things loved going in like the post apocalyptic setting the game isn perfect and while things like the 9s hacking and route pushed lot of people away still thoroughly enjoyed it getting ending and the final shut em up section in the credits ending with me giving up my save file to protect fellow player is one of the most beautiful moments ve seen in fiction as whole,1
verdadeiro goty 2017 zelda é caralho vai tomar no cu ryuji,0
this game is great and to many people this is probably one of the greatest jrpgs if not overall game of all time see that 100 but personally have my nitpicks with it such as n the pacing of the game n the fact it only gets good 30 40 hours into the game n the fact that essential strategic and most importantly fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party mid battle n the lack of freedom to do what you want n similar to smt iv iv and maybe other smt persona games idk they sell dlc for super powerful personas in smtiv at least these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them in persona 5 royal they included the dlc which again could ignore if they are optional but can unlike in pervious games there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straight up just get these p2w personas naturally which absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window n and more importantly the entirety of kasumi character pre third semester want to punch her ,1
vanilla was my first persona and smt game kinda feels like coming home whenever play it,1
if you have spare 100 hours lying around do this was pretty good 4 better tho ,1
i love goro akechi,1
played like 50 hrs guess finished half or two thirds of it cannot say didn like persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last played some smt games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful especially the 4th however cannot say that persona 5 is bad game although my experience with it was bit rough had this state of waiting for something like 5 10 hours more and something incredible would happen for sure characters pull off some weird moves and the real persona the one everyone is so hyped up about would begin never happened might finish it sometime later tho whenever vibes come back ,0
like nya ,1
one of the greatest games have ever played ,1
god of war is game that understands its audience kratos is now as tired and old as all of us who played the original games back on the ps2 ,0
one of the best games of the ps4 generation that game changes the style of gow saga and it hits in the middle of the target it a master piece the story deep imersive and the world of that gow so vivid and beautiful m not sure if the new gameplay an upgrade but it enjoyable n 9 6,1
this is my fav game of all time everything about it is amazing,1
soy muy tonto scar tissue como dicen los chavales de ahora,0
thought portal was good this game is beyond that this game adds full narrative with characters and guarantee hearing banter between wheatley glad0s and cave johnson k simmons is far better than anything heard today ,1
i not trying to brag but bloodborne wasn much of challenge for me the beginning was little hard since bloodborne mechanics are quite different compared to the dark souls trilogy but few tries and deaths are enough for someone to get used to the way you play ,0
my favourite in the soulsborne series ,1
i have very conflicting opinion of this game that may require me to go back for another playthrough ,0
brilliant incredible amazing show stopping spectacular ,1
perfect,1
the greatest game of all time ,1
my absolute favorite platformer,1
im bad at platforming,0
muito maneiro personagens cativantes o pós jogo chega muitas vezes até ser mais divertido para quem gosta de desafio ,0
one of the imo best gaming experiences you can find to this day the dialouge is adorable and heartfelt the music is utterly stunning and the gameplay and level design is that perfect mix of challenging and fun where you sit there for hours just wanting to complete that one jump doing it over and over and when you do complete it you feel so proud of yourself,1
this is peak it is one of my favorite games its so good not only is the story amazing but side content makes the game feel like real world,1
i wish japan was real,0
super enjoyed this game loved the story and the characters and the entire vibe of it the combat didn super click with me but still had fun beating up enemies and even more fun beating up story characters,1
overrated as fuck,0
sacrifices fun for the sake of realism,1
portal desolate labs with mind bending puzzles are unforgettable the concept of portals themselves are strange but put into gameplay loops really force you to think with portals ,0
genuinely fun puzzle game that makes me realize my iq is in fact negative but that won stop me from drinking all of the poison goo what it gonna do block my path now already drank it all ,1
a really great game just didn stick out as much as it predecessor 64,1
inspiring how mario can feel so fresh and original after so many years ,1
i played this game so many times dont ever wanna touch it again,1
i mean objectively the best mario game just like galaxy more,0
yeah mario games hit,0
the first 3d mario game have truly loved and completed 100 the near perfection of an already glorious formula ,1
the more mature story by recent pokémon standards lore ramifications for sinnoh and the amazing real time catch mechanics make this game one of the best pokémon games ever easily though good pokémon is still far from being good video game generally speaking the textures are muddy the levels especially alabaster icelands and cobalt coastlands feel janky and overly linear despite the game encouraging more mobile movement and freedom and of course the lack of meaningful presentation through stiff character animations and lack of voice acting hurt this game alot still feel like pokémon gameplay has peaked here but they just don let these games cook long enough and only get away with it because pokémon fans only play pokémon and don branch out to know what actually good,1
really refreshing take on the series just little empty overall ,1
great game but it would be better if there was voice acting and no sudden cutscenes every 2 seconds and it gets pretty bad as you play it but if you re finding good first pokemon game would recommend it tho ,1
aside from obvious performance issues this was easily the most fun ive had with the pokemon series since the release of black white hope we get follow up game in the future that focuses on the unova region and kyurem,0
put me in feudal japan with an iphone and probably wouldn get as far as did here,0
pla the best pokémon game ve ever played and why ll probably never play another pokémon game in my life,1
it was great game all round ending felt little rushed,0
a whole lot of soul put into this game forgot how much really loved hack and slash and especially rhythm musical at the top of it makes it extremely fun was pretty cool story with fun cast overall banger of game and definitely favorites of the year ,1
isso aqui é um absurdo,0
this game came out of no where and felt like it hit me like sucker punch from professional boxer always have soft spot for good rhythm game and hi fi rush hits that spot just right ,1
this game is so jank but so entertaining,1
metal gear rising revengeance review memes raiden memes ,0
feel like would have enjoyed this game much more if hack slash was my kind of game,1
people be rating this 3 bitch be serious ,0
incredible spectacle and movie esque cutscenes backed up by memorable characters inarguably one of the most recognizable games of the decade however is held back by lackluster gameplay ,1
bom jogo importante pra caramba tudo mais mas sinceramente tantas horas de gameplay me divertiram muito mas me recepcionaram na história não que eu eu esperasse algo muito elaborado mas senti que não foi conclusiva ou evoluísse os personagens é divertido muito mesmo a liberdade é ótima passei muito tempo jogando tênis dirigindo pelas colinas fazendo coisas aleatórias a experiência é ótima em pleno começo de 2023 talvez não seja lá grande coisa jogar um jogo assim no sentido de muita coisa legal pra fazer mas na época era uma baita inovação merece respeito pelo que até hoje impressiona ,0
i really wanted to love this game more the playing world is stunning with colorful and great recreations of actual locations and landmarks having to juggle between 3 characters is brilliant idea but found the story to be bit lackluster and overall did not feel as involved with the protagonists as much as was with the previous game ,1
i love the setting lore visuals and the god tier soundtrack but what played of the story was just ok and the side content is very dull m gonna be honest edgerunners baited me into buying this game and it my fault,0
besides the pretty colors and cool rtx visuals this game falls flat on its face if this game was like car it would be 99 honda civic with 5k rims ,1
i thought would enjoy the story didn everything else is n ok n ,1
enjoyable like it when gun goes bang and vibe be like futuristic ,1
deep storytelling intense gameplay beautiful graphics ,0
an amazing sequel to it previous but think the pervious game is superior in the story ,1
a sequel to one of the biggest games of 2018 and it beyond bloated as hell ,0
gow 2018 is my second favorite game of all time right next to the original half life and this was big disappointment ,1
clapped at the end like white people on plane,1
not my fav xb game didn grow attached to the cast in general and overall felt that the game always wanted to show me how great it was compared to the others which didn like ,1
i love this video game,1
most of the content consume doesn affect me emotionally but even experienced an emotional damage from xenoblade chronicles 3 because its world was so depressive and the musics were supporting that depressive atmosphere thanks to tetsuya takahashi great storytelling found myself caring about the characters the story and of course the world ,0
this certainly was long game for context have played xenoblade 1dx and seen 2 on youtube so will mostly probobly be comparing it to xenoblade 1 the concept is immedietly quite interesting although,0
hmmmmmmm kind of divisive one here for me personally while liked the characters the plot felt kind of lacking and the connections to the other games in the series that were so hyped up by nintendo in marketing really didn add to much if anything you could have replaced the references to the previous games with original stuff and nothing substantial would be different in that aspect this game was really disappointing the villains were also an absolute joke with the mobius guys being the most generically boring guys in history and being immensely less cool the more you learn about him in terms of the gameplay though it was certainly fun the class system makes combat very customizable and feel its absolutely possible to sink your teeth really into managing your party to get the most out of all your options also did lot of side content in this game which is uncharacteristic of me as beelined it through the first two games exploration of the worlds is always fun in xenoblade games and this is no exception perhaps am just getting tired of the series but this definitely didn hit as much as the first or even the second game to me still would suggest to anyone that enjoyed the first two games because the gameplay is still fun but like yeaaaahh ,0
kirby and the forgotten land is one of the harder games for me to rate the reason for this is what think of the game vs my own personal feelings with the game ,0
keep making games like this hal,1
incredible jump to 3d for the kirby games while still managing to feel like classic kirby title the game makes amazing use of 3d environments to add new layer of exploration and creativity to every single level and had lot of fun clearing the main and extra stories with all bonus challenges while the main content is easy and very chill bonus optional content can be very tricky only thing disliked were few difficulty spikes in some side objectives and the lack of restart from checkpoint button but overall this is masterful game that makes the most out of its simplicity as kirby game but this time you can swallow whole car and spit it unharmed ,0
kirby and the ermmmmm goat n if future kirby games are like this totally wouldn mind that the gameplay is quite honestly an upgrade to the original formula the bosses quite specifically are the most fun fights ve had in quite while great stuff right here,1
perhaps the best kirby game since 64 and roboplanet with great ability upgrades inventive levels great bosses and of course thick layer of cute smothered all over every aspect ,1
replayed with the kids the later levels and the treasure road portals make great use of every power the hidden waddle dees push you to explore sure but also demand perfection for few bosses and the forgotten islands prove the developers knew exactly what they were doing few enemies get additional move sets that expertly increase the pressure if anything wanted dodge move to help me out some more n kept easy on the entire play through and barely scraped by the back part of the game yet it always changing enemy and levels up enough that it never feels repetitive if anything was left wanting just taste more n overall great kirby game and great video game ,0
a captivating journey from start to finish this uses its characters and dialogue to such great effect making everything feel intertwined our protagonist mind especially was so interesting to delve into and finding out little bits and pieces of his identity was just joy to do while the game lets do things without kitsuragi at times never wanted to as he brought much to every scene he was active in very satisfying resolution and to top it off its simply hilarious at times as well n love kim kitsuragi sm,1
i love you kim kitsuragi,1
one of the most interesting politically poignant pieces of art ve ever had the pleasure of consuming,0
i couldn finish day 1 playing this game feels like chore which is never good sign this was my second attempt at finishing the game and actually got lot further than on my first one might pick this up again sometime in the future but don think this game is for me ,1
still unsure whether like the ending or not and for game with some of the best worldbuilding ve ever seen wish more of the game had to do with that world but at the end of the day it still the best writing any game has ever had so can be too mad,0
best spider man game easily only nostalgia can beat it ,1
really makes you feel like spider man,1
just incredible the story tears the gameplays so fun ,1
finally beat this one after 5 years not as enjoyable as the other souls like for me and can really put my finger on it but it was still dark souls so overall good time ,1
perfect ,1
this was fun we played so many times,1
todos os elogios versão original se aplicam aqui porém meu apego pelo nier gestalt não me deixa dar nota máxima pra esse remake sem contar que ele tentou copiar bastante automata isso me desagradou bastante principalmente no visual que eu achava fantástico no original ,0
muito bom porem embora seja um remake ainda continua com uma cara de jogo antigo me prendeu até primeiro final não tankei fazer todos os outros 4,0
nier is such memorable game that changed the ways that stories could be told playing the game again and again to see different perspectives and context is such creative tool when given limited tools the gameplay is fun and is just classic hack and slash with magic tools that are all fun to use against enemies ,1
we all know the importance of this game and what it brought to video games as whole ,0
some fun jumping,1
the perfect sudo conclusion to the series that just takes all of the best elements of mario and expands upon them hot take actually like the camera in this game,1
a masterpiece easily in the conversation of the best game of all time this is coming from someone with no nostalgia tied to it and playing it 27 years after release blown away by how well it holds up especially in terms of level design and platforming the camera was minor nuisance not enough to detract from the value and the controls were not problem aged like wine ,1
i a captain falcon main sadge,0
sakurai gotta stop doing this to urself,1
it is without doubt the definitive version of well refined formula just never had fun playing any of the games in the franchise bought this one hoping the solo mode would deliver unfortunately it never ending grind with very little payoff ,1
fantastic music great art style obviously and really fun gameplay definitely had me picking up the controller again instead of breaking tv call that patience ,1
a great boss rush game with great 1930s cartoony art style the only drawback is the inclusion of linear stages that are too easy and not interesting enough that they shouldn have been included ,1
a brilliant hard but clever and never unfair run and gun shooter the platformer levels were unnecessary and are not as good as the others though ,1
i ve had bit of troubled history with cuphead before now ve tried it on two different occasions both with varying results my first attempt ended pretty swiftly since didn have controller and the keyboard controls are really bad the game didn quite jive with me at that point but my main problem at that point was the hell that is cuphead with keyboard controls year or two later would play through the whole game and later the dlc in co op with friend we did this over steam so there was bit of lag but had controller and friend to help me through enjoyed the game lot more to the point where was the one pushing us to do the dlc together but it still didn quite enamour me like d wanted it to my main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses felt that lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen often with them all acting completely independently have huge amount of trouble processing all of that information so oftentimes found bosses just far too overwhelming not design issue or anything more of personal one ,0
im waiting for this game to grab me but it hasn happened yet n dont know why enjoy dying to the same boss for 3 hours in soulsborne games but not in this game ,1
loved this lot missed the sense of exploration from dark souls but the core action mechanics and satisfying parries more than made up for it other than basic whole number for your damage and health there ,0
o worryi,0

ark souls n because n there was nothing in my way except my own skill which greatly prefer no main bosses that required some stupid consumable item for me to defeat properly don like feeling as if need to grind to make myself better because then it this vague guessing game of numbers there were few points in,1
must have been over levelled or,1
i bought this game on nintendo switch with 20 dollar switch gift card bought myself as end of the school year present just finished sophomore year and life was pretty rough started playing ff7 and my life began to change lil bit was so confused playing it but that just made me want to play it more used to work at summer camp and on the bus ride there would take my switch and play it 40 minutes there 40 minutes back so on average played an hour and 20 minutes day of ff7 ,0
play dragon quest instead,0
honestly not that good as some people say but still interesting and some characters are cool,1
this guy are sick,0
really chill of them to add random encounter toggle and x3 speed setting to accommodate for my rapidly disintegrating frontal lobe,0
what the hell do even say here it ff7 it beautiful story wise at least ,1
mfw bitches and whores,0
i love this game so my review is very biased there are many many flaws with this game given its age for example the decade old naoto trans debate she not she comes to terms with the fact she can be strong self righteous detective and woman the topic is just handled poorly think this game speaks for the improvement in handling similar topics in newer games and that really important regardless this is an absolutely amazing game and one of my favorites of all time and would definitely recommend it to anyone willing to try it n added bonus the soundtrack is awesome,1
naoto is just like me fr fr,1
lo amé todo el tiempo estando jugando el 5 ahora es más lento tosco con mil millones de cosas menos pero la música es mil veces mejor tiene una historia increible,0
genuinely one of the most enjoyable and fun games ever,1
it alright the story is really interesting but the gameplay is bit bland you have to sacrifice your entire hard drive just to install updates every 2 days though,0
i had my genshin phase around the time raiden shogun was announced played lot for while then stopped right before the new dendro area dropped it sallright,1
5 stars for me but let me be really clear this game feels like really big hit or miss feel like there are some misconceptions about this game that if you don come with that bias from the beginning it actually super enjoyable ,1
solid first 12 hours,1
signalis is an absolute treat taking inspiration from the classic survival horror games on playstation 1 developer rose engine has crafted unique experience that will stick with me for awhile ,1
silent hill 2 with lesbians,1
silent hill 2 for lesbians nothing special ,1
got the platinum and did everything on this replay there is no other game quite like this one survival horror masterpiece ,1
i beat this fully in 2 days 7 hours on my first day and 9 on my second day and did promise ending and artifact and im just sitting here basking in it,0
this game is what every resident evil game should strive to be lots of action while also scary at the same time the factory section is bit of snooze fest but thankfully it doesnt last that long and once your done with it the game picks up the pace ,0
resident evil village é oitavo jogo da franquia resident evil continuando história de ethan winters re village se passa 3 anos após os acontecimentos de resident evil 7 ,0
emotional support duke,1
ethan winters is an american hero,1
they got rid of the fun part,1
bro this game is immaculate what else is there to say chef kiss 5 stars yahoo,1
mario peaked here,0
while didn love galaxy as much as other people did it still remains in my eyes as very solid 3d platformer with beautiful graphics and lots of innovations in terms of gameplay at least when compared to previous 3d mario titles ,1
there are almost no bad mario games but galaxy is such slow game that it makes me want to take nap and have actually fallen asleep at least three times while playing,0
the only bad part of this game is matthew perry voice acting,0
probably my favorite wrpg period there is no experiences that can really top this besides the 2 other games in the series before it inception,1
this game is overrated but peak,0
the story is incredibly strong with tons of fun and memorable characters enjoyed going around exploring and learning about the politics and lore of the world also trans girl game trans girl game the only place this game lost significant points with me was in the combat which found fairly tedious and enough of problem enough of the time to seriously take away my motivation to play this game caesar legion is one of my favorite factions in any video game and the elvis impersonators are hilarious really need to go back and get all three main endings ,1
trans rights whooooooooo ,1
my indecisiveness and reluctance to sacrifice one quest for another is the other thing stopping me continuing,1
replayed with my girlfriend still the best game of all time nothing compares,1
the more think about this game the more love it and realize how unique it is n such an amazing feeling exploring this solar system contemplating the infinite dark space with the beautiful score playing so satisfying to unravel the mysteries and to understand what you need to do especially when you need to be little bold there a big sense of cohesion in this whole game n the ending is really powerful and you can really feel that you re witnessing something big n it not my personnal favorite game of all time yet feel like it might the best game ever made if that makes sense ,1
my favorite game ever,1
the most engaging puzzles riddles ive ever seen in game solutions are very clever but not unfair exploring the planets and their ruins and stumbling on all kinds of crazy shit is great time and unraveling the mystery one step at time so you can piece together the bigger picture is incredibly satisfying the environment design is also amazing and the concepts in the later portions of the game are so cool and interesting cant elaborate because of spoilers the dlc is just okay though ngl exploring the setting was cool but it felt like lot of running around doing busy work for very little reward,1
fantastic game from start to finish the curiosity and confusion in the beginning before you experience and realize the loop for the first time is breath of fresh air not much direction just some input from npcs about space mission and before you know it you are uncovering secrets of fallen race and the death of the universe the experience is underlined with fantastic score and the design of the puzzles is great it a bit tiresome when you get stuck and feel like you re just too dense to progress but when things fall in place and do make sense it fantastic when you finally piece everything together know exactly what you need to do and where is an undescribeable feeling this is very much as close as you can get to perfect game,0
my entry point of the series don ask this remake of my first entry of the series and causing it to grow my love for the series in general this game is really really good and had fun time overall when playing this game and since m rating this out of pure nostalgia of raccoon city and overall experience think this game really deserves 5 stars but when playing this game got really bad luck with its rng of mr and some lickers since they actually keep killing me and at one point made somewhat of stun lock move so have to take out half star but it still worth playing since it is very beautiful upgrade to the game played as kid and it as good as remember,0
a really well done vision of what survival horror games could be and great remake of this beloved classic in general ,1
i dont have much to say but really like this game its what you expect from resident evil ,0
peak survival horror,1
lembro de ter jogado no ano de lançamento ter ficado encantado com toda imersão do jogo de um ar obscuro que já havia visto em resident evil 7 após anos decidi jogar original percebi tantas novas camadas daquela época que comecei ser mais critico em comparação esse jogo agora em 2023 retornei jogar platinei jogo também percebi que por mais que ele apresente problemas ele é impressionante ,0
recomendado aunque se hace muy repetitivo ,1
i really want to like this game but the gameplay doesnt really change much if you played it for an hour you ve pretty much seen it all ,1
ripped and teared,0
fun but fucking annoying,0
shoot kill move reload shoot kill move reload move shoot move reload move shoot kill move reload never stop moving ,0
the more think about this game the more like it tbh like the changes to combat and this game actually made me want to do physical build for the main character which did and was fun went for true neutral ending might get around to doing the other endings after playing some other smt games nahobino based,0
like pokémon but funner,1
after having played several entries in the smt franchise was incredibly hyped for this game overall it didn meet my expectations set by prior entries ,0
i love the gameplay character designs and music but the story of this game was distractingly awful even though the narrative isn ever really the forefront of smt when dazai took off his hat and slicked back his hair after lost my mind he is truly the law rep ever,0
this was the first atlus game decided to try out and had pretty good time it a really fun monster collector with some fantastic music an incredibly fun combat system with tons of expression and some pretty great presentation theres just level of quality here that appreciate n sooo n much you can really tell they polished the 𝗦𝗛𝗜𝗧 out of this game imma big fan ,1
great but hate the cheap one hit kill qtes very pronounced lack of enemy variety that gets amended in later titles in the series,0
beat em all at its best with weird and frankly off putting enemy design ,0
at this point lost the count of how many times played this game,0
played for like couple hours and got board ðÿ xadðÿ xad n it was fun during those hours tho ðÿ ,1
amazing harvest moon story of seasons like game ,1
guys how do marry willy guys,0
harvest moon without the patriarchal religious theming that makes those games interesting essentially just carnist busywork that panders to gay zoomers,0
the story is up its own ass but still has its good moments gameplay carries this game hard why cant developers just add roguelike modes to their games to let you infinitely explore games mechanics as much as you want with no interruptions ,0
deeply regret letting friends convince me to sink my life into the mediocre stealth action game wrapped in 30 hours of rock stupid misery porn that is the last of us 2 wish d just played another life is strange for 100 less psychotic lesbian smooch sci fi story game in 1 3 of the time ,0
lets be serious anyone who hates this is closeted gay man,0
beautiful looking game and excellent gameplay that more in depth and challenging than the original the pacing is so bad there are several character motivations that fall flat aren executed the best and the ending is almost unbelievable motivation wise but the themes and good story moments stick with you and acting is top notch across the board will revisit this again at later date for the grounded playthrough after which ll update my thoughts and go more in depth ,0
what did like ,1
you know game is that good when even the tank controls don suck masterpiece in nearly every way imaginable ,1
fuck tha puzzles man ,0
peak atmosphere let down heavily by gameplay that way too easy and lets down the incredible tension built by the writing environments and sound design if bloober were competent they just copy and paste the entire game and increase enemy movement speed and reduce ammo by 20 or something like that,1
if hadn learned the plot twist would have given 5 ,0
the best game ever made that other games will forever try to live up to and fail ,0
one of my favorite games of all time incredible open world with some of the best side quest stories in any video game the game is full of compelling characters that make the world feel alive and interesting it the antithesis of ubisoft open world games it a world you are compelled to explore and learn more about not world where you re just ticking boxes sometimes the open world is arguably too much it a daunting game and difficult to recommend unless you have the time to fully engross yourself in it the only complaints ever had was that the combat is bit clumsy but you get used to it as fan of the books loved experiencing real continuation of many of the stories told in the books also gwent rules n n disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 7 years ago ,1
wind howling,1
great writing and worldbuilding unfortunately the gameplay gets stale quickly the combat is floaty and controlling geralt feels delayed unresponsive ,0
everytime beat this game feel bitter sweet and empty after because the writing and characters are so good that you forget your time with them is limited ,0
é meu jogo favorito da vida tenho um puta apego emocional mas tem vários defeitos tipo controle do carpeado pelo fator replay que ao fazer as mesmas missoes pelo menos tres vezes ja chega ser enjoativo ,0
masterpiece,1
just play royal instead bro why reading this ,0
literally best game ever till they released persona 5 royal goro akechi defender,1
persona 5 changed me didn play jrpg or games too often until played this one everything about p5 oozes with flair looked at the flashy ui design and was shocked as ve never seen something so creative before ,0
a lot of talking not lot of showing and yet can stop playing ,1
i love this game to pieces,1
recomendado,1
rip and fart,0
i like it more if could delete the platforming,1
bom jogo bem divertido viceral nada mais relaxante que estripar lacerar demônios em uma gameplay frenética ao som de metal com mundo explodindo ao seu redor ,0
i feel like wet rat in bathtub when play this game take that as you will ,1
i ve tried playing this game for 80 hours stopped after was bored to death and still unsure was actually following the actual storyline or if there even was any ,0
i have had lot of fun in skyrim just wandering around and making up my own story in my head but the moment run into fully authored quests my enjoyment dips vastly,1
special edition da anniversary edition da bunu da oynadım tam olarak eşi yok sanırım eşi yok demez bu oyun inanilmaz harika demek degil sadece aynı özgürlük ve immersion veren bir oyun bulamadım keske ilk oynadıgım zamanlara geri dönebilsem ,0
everyone got their game day of release but amazon delivered mine 4 days late and that honestly killed my ability to get excited about anything for the rest of my life felt iconic at the time though didn it ,1
esse jogo é muito bom dos jogos de speedrun esse é mais divertido n história desse jogo é legalzinha não compre esperando um jogo com história complexa tocante é uma história bobinha só para não deixar os personagem estarem ali só por estar n melhor parte do jogo é definitivamente gameplay o level desing esses dois fatores combinam tão bem juntos que depois de se acostumar ao jogo mesmo sendo primeira vez na fase tu já vê um possível atalho ou ate mesmo um segredo n acho esse jogo muito pouco reconhecido tanto que eu só fui descobrir que ele lançou 4 meses depois do seu lançamento ,0

rack is incredible the game has an arcade dreamcas,1
ing the way forward to get the best times if this game was just level select screen think it might be my favorite game of the year thus far but sadly this game has one major flaw and that is the plot it an incredibly stereotypical anime amnesia plot full of boring psychopathic enemies cringy sexual innuendos and awful voice acting yes know the guy who played spike is in it but this is not his best performance ended up muting the voice audio and that helped quite bit but the plot still has nothing to offer if you skip all the cutscenes though think this game is definitely must play this gets 4 stars because of the great artstyle tier machine girl music interesting gameplay gimmics and great level design 1 star for the story and visual novel aspects neon white é uma mistura de fps com visual novel pode parecer uma mistura estranha primeiro momento n mas depois de alguns minutos de gameplay esse jogo vai sugar sua alma até os segundos finais da gameplay n agora pega isso coloca um toque de speedrun pronto neon white n gameplay é absurdamente pra,0

i dont think ive ever enjoyed shooting less ,1
same game 2 but little better,1
re4 is good game and revolutionized third person shooters at the time but this is not survival horror never once felt any tension playing this game and thats why play resident evil,1
the game that got me hooked on the resident evil series ,0
a game that manages to perfectly blend the survival horror formula that resident evil popularised with something resembling what was at the time the future of the third person genre every aspect of it is designed to ramp up the tension and keep you in this sweet spot of just about surviving the horrors by the skin of your arse there a reason the controls are like that the guns feel like that the enemies react like that the music sounds like that everything is geared towards making you feel like the game is constantly turning the screw and thanks to the adaptive dificulty it usually fucking is ,1
cotland parker kennedy this was the first resident evil game played and finished it remained as such for over 15 years they were at bingo,0
what good fucking villain ,0
man they dropped the ball still good tho,1
masterpiece,1
remake de um clássico da história dos jogos respeita jogo antigo não faz mudanças bruscas ao mesmo tempo que moderniza gameplay a deixa bem mais parecida com actions rpg atuais com the witcher 3 ff xv no mais jogo se prolonga demais em algumas partes desnecessáriamente a história acaban progredindo de maneira extremamente lenta fazendo com quem em algumas partes jogo se torne extremamente monótono,0
hate to be hater but man did hate this may as well lean into it by far one of the least pleasurable and enjoyable experiences ve ever had with video game in any capacity with anything really spread out and torturous over 30 aching hours determined to finish this and think it counts for something this is my first experience with final fantasy so can say how entirely faithful it is to the original know the big plot beats but like really this is the story that hit for so many people even in the differences this remake brings n really do just have too much to say about this and don really know where to begin about it all for the positives this is obviously incredible looking and uhhh yeah really like barrett but other than that it a struggle this thing really is emblematic of so many issues have with lot of gaming in general so self serious with huge misses when attempting anything light refuse to believe there are honest to god wedge stans out there giving us so many cinematics having the gameplay consist of another 5 or so steps along corridor and bam here another cutscene dialogue and vocal direction sucks cloud is an absolute black hole of charisma nobody is fun to play as except for barrett who has the most simple combat systems out of the 4 options ,0
recomendado,1
sonic frontiers é mais novo jogo do sonic porém ele não é só mais um jogo qualquer da franquia é nova direção da série sendo tão diferente quanto adventure unleashed mas será que sonic frontiers é um bom jogo mesmo com algumas polêmicas resposta é sim ele é um ótimo jogo ,0
maybe ll try again in the future but this isn doing it for me it was alright at first but soon outstayed it welcome ,1
excited for the sequel assuming they don completely change the formula again because this is really solid foundation that feels fresh if little bare bones at times super fun to run around and the music is really nice glad to have story where the characters take the events seriously without joking every 5 seconds the story itself is ok but the final act is clearly unfinished and rushed has probably one of the worst final bosses in the whole series which really undermines the ending bit excited for the content updates sega needs to give these devs the time and resources to release game in fully finished state ,1
man kinda forced myself to beat this kinda fun tho,1
wow really fucking cool game honestly the most fun card game ve ever played and it worked in every iteration want full versions of each ngl so fun ,1
one of the best games from 2021 hate card battle games but this one has me excited to come back for more ,1
the card game itself is good the elements beyond the card game take it up notch,1
its hard to say alot about what like about this game without spoiling it but it a must play to me incredibly fun card system interesting narrative and story that goes deeper then you expect best played blind ,1
the story is amazing and the atmosphere really helps to get inmersed in this world where your life depends on how you play your cards n still need to finish the kaycee mod but for now it completed to me,1
peak near flawless game for me and really encapsulates what love about the medium exceptional effort and turned out just as well as d hoped ve beaten it 5 times now granted new game plus with all your upgrades and knowing where to go makes it much easier did find it to be very difficult at points and it can be somewhat easy to get lost also vital system for progression can be too cryptic but rewarding once you crack it that about my only gripes must play game gorgeous artstyle no handholdy nonsense fun gameplay top tier ost great story and an overall perfect action adventure game it littered with secrets as well so your exploration is rewarded pay attention to the manual andrew shouldice goated fr 5 5 ,1
tunic is wonderful 2d zelda like that feels like love letter to the genre between an extremely charming aesthetic fun and interesting items and being extremely packed with puzzles and mystery it would be hard not to recommend this game to any fan of the genre the inclusions of things like made up language and the instruction booklet all work to great effect to simulate that feeling you had when you were kid trying to play game like link awakening discovery is always well rewarded and always feel earned by the player feel as though there are very few handouts in terms of progression through the game so even just simply navigating the world feels meaningful and accomplishing level design is top notch in this game and love all the secrets and hidden paths they provide using the game isometric view think the weakest parts of this game compared to its contemporaries is the mood of the game ,1
esse é único jogo que eu me motivei platinar é rápido tranquilo divertido os mistérios desse jogo meu deus eu nunca vi nenhum jogo apresentar suas mecânicas dessa forma coisas que você poderia fazer desde início mas só foi aprender na metade por isso que voltar nos lugares é tão incrível porque você volta diferente com conhecimento tunic pra mim foi uma experiência única onde eu pensava sim que ia gostar mas não imaginava nem de longe as coisas que ia me fazer sentir minha opinião sobre esse game é algo pessoal demais é com certeza meu indie preferido ,0

i have bad habit of not beating video games even though haven beaten ocarina of time ve gotten far enough into it to tell that it good and if you need me to tell you that it good then you re bit of silly little guy goober if you will,0
as years go by still enjoy this succesful transition from 2d to 3d of the series but its rather formulaic structure make me prefer bolder approaches such as subsequent episodes ,1
childhood game and probably played it about 8 times through timeless classic n remaster is good too but never finished it,1

my mom never let me play video games during the week so as kid coming home from school on friday was big deal really never saved my money for video games at the time so essentially played this game for 2 years constantly the free roaming is great the story is engaging and experimental even though there are issues with bugs it still is an incredible game that think everybody should play ,0

ive played this game like 20 times,1
the combat in this game is insane the open world is enjoyable overall story is pretty good game makes you say ,1
this game is really good game in it own right however there are some mechanics that prefer in yakuza zero still great time however ,1
thought should give the series chance after hearing nothing but praise for these games over the last few years understand why so many people love them but yeah not for me the weirdness is not my kind of weird and the seriousness isn my kind of serious don love combo based combat kind of hate non expressive roleplaying rpg mechanics and the length of put down the controller cutscenes just kind of had me at an arm length maybe it great later on but know what isn gonna go down smooth these days ,0

this is an 8 but like being dad ,1
a lot of really good setpiece moments but on the whole this game is kind of mess in most departments the faults aren enough to be deal breaker and there some real all timer moments here and there but this game is nightmare in terms of pacing it still fun to play gun guys are there though so it isn the most fun to play at points but sometimes it can feel bit clunky against the faster enemies and bosses even in the fastest fighting style majima everywhere can just go to hell too ,0
truly one of the greatest visual novels ever released if not the best it has memorable lively unique and lovable cast of characters though miles edgeworth is obviously the one who shines the most which is not something we usually encounter in visual novel the cases gradually got better and better and the last case was literal masterpiece the fourth case was my favorite though since the character development in this is just so heartwarming the dialogue in this game never ever bored me did not skip one dialogue in this game and this is the first time this happened to me in visual novel everything is just so well written the story is always exciting and makes you curious about what will happen in the next testimony and you also always wonder how the things will turn out while investigating the soundtrack and the character sprites are also very well done and both of these play big role in this game charm n to summarize all of the written above phoenix wright ace attorney has the most fun you can have in visual novel and is overall phenomenal video game ,1
a great start to the legendary lawyer ,1
edgeworth love you please be real,1

vi anime uma vez pretendo jogar,0
basically impossible to enjoy if you haven already been playing it for like decade,1
it would take so little effort to make this playable game in casual but until then will just keep lamenting all the meme servers disappearing,0
funny n bots are annoying tho,0
i have wasted so much money on this game it shameful,0
game is good but not as good as first ,1
bad game fanservice and british people this game blows ,0
really good game had it fair share of awkward anime moments overall but really hit close to home at some point and had very lovable characters the zekenator babyyy,1
after being skeptical for year after it was announced because of the game taking place in rough post apocalypse desert trope love splatoon 2 for avoiding despite it post apocalypse setting eventually came around as the release date came closer and more promising things were revealed this turned out pretty good more splatoon with more stuff but unfortunately doesn reach any of 2 heights except for some of the new gameplay tweaks playing friends is better than ever but d rather go back to 2 in every other regards,0
yet to be bad splatoon game,0
campaign wasn as good as octo expansion 3 felt like mix of the splat 2 campaign and octo n still yet to beat the after alternae the final level cause it made me too mad lmao n online is cool as well though fell out of playing it 33,0
get this shit off my screen m trying to browse my backloggd,0
classic,1
 played before 2023 n mean it is silly little infinte game that you play when your internet is down and there is literally nothing to do you jump over things until you hit something night and day shifts are cool for browser game but nothing really interesting and think acting like this is anything better than something to play for five minutes while your router is restarting is kinda silly ,1
um dos jogos mais classicos da internet ele tem muito mas da pro gasto quando estamos sem internet é de longe melhor dos navegadores na minha opiniao sei tem outros ,1
it fairly good combat is crunchy if not perfectly controllable plot interesting even if the dialogue can get bit too dense sometimes music is good even if it hard to appreciate in context it just bit short the ending is bit abrupt although not entirely unsatisfying and the game doesn get enough time to really flesh out the mechanics so getting the rest out of your purchase is left to the speedrun mode which suffers from some of the less pleasant bits club stealth section straight from hell it not bad enough to leave you wanting though m not big on the slow motion mechanic either the slow mo is too extreme to be fun to use in combat and the systems are usually more fun to engage with in real time ,0
pure perfection personally need to go back to this game and 100 it before the dlc comes out if it ever will ,1
short and sweet beat it in one sitting love it,1
how the fuck do even explain in this shit is just that good,0
don t really know what this was but it was cool,1
waiting with great excitement on that dlc sequel ye,1
a beautiful story that think is one of the best games in the choose your own adventure genre of video games even if your choices along the way don ,1
ust change the,0
on love the en,1
rd n n disclaimer these are my brief tho,0
i hate this star wars prequel esque rewriting of history about ds2 it still very obviously the worst in the series,0
the complete 180 this game took in comparison to its predecessor in every way is kind of fuckin appaling the interconnectedness and metroidvania ness of the level design is gone in its stead the entire world is several long linear corridors one after another n aesthetically it everything liked the least about ds1 dialed up to 100 and all the cooler stuff removed n gameplaywise it feels so much more floaty so much more uncomfortable so much worse can even explain it quite well the whole entire atmosphere the game gives me sort of makes everything just feel so much more ugly and shitty ,0
light sick substantially worse than the first but still more quality to be had than imitators and other big budget games of its era ve found that infusing my weapons has turned my good damage to trash so m currently farming to undo that ,0
that the harshest score ve given souls game wouldn have made it through without friends to keep my sanity at bay ,0
replaying this game and beating every boss except the ancient dragon and vendrick both of which aren fights they are just gigantic health bars with legs in under week made me realize that not only am a fucking freak of nature with no time management but that this game is in weird middle ground where everyone opinion on it is simultaneously wrong and right ,0
arkane oyunlarına alışamadım,0
deathloop in concept is cool but when executed these ideas don particularly mesh well and make good game ,1
fun but doesn help that colt isn that interesting and the ending felt deflated ,0
maybe ll come back to it later enjoyed some of it but it has some level design issues and just feels bland also don like how areas feel to distant ,0
dishonored but kinda not great annoying dialogue plays like bioshock 1 but released in 2021 ,1
i like how you have to figure out some sort of mechanic for each boss it ,1
d love the fact that you re fighti,1
and it a lot more entertaining than just dodge block attack heal ,1
a game well ahead of its time which means it not very pleasant to play on an original ps2 anymore the remake for ps4 ps5 is the definitive way to experience shadow of the colossus but it might be worth playing the original version just to be impressed by what the game managed to do for its time ,1
que jogo gostoso da porra mlk pensar que um jogo de matar colosso poderia ser absurdo uma mas delicia que os outros tirando os quadrupedes alguns são meme menos que você derruba as colunas aquele sim é maneiro n como eu queria ter sido mais inteligente quando menor teria jogado isso antes n ps2 em 2005 sofria firme em ,0
o mundo vazio cinza entre os colossos definitivamente não é pra todo mundo mas viajar por esses terrenos mortos só adicionou experiência melancólica do jogo pra mim os colossos são uma aula de boss fight level design música design é impressionante como eles transformam um só bicho numa fase completa ,0
good game but it has an empty and boring world not such good story but you may enjoy some boss battles n 5 8,1
played this game fully with friend on hard mode and it was blast ,0
cowabunga bitches,0
rating 7 8 10 pretty good,1
played through this twice now once with my friend and once on my own good game was never much of tmnt fan at all but have just never had the time to really get into it the era of ninja turtles that most intrest me like im sure many is the 80s cartoon era this game is really cool time capsule of not only by playing into the iconic gameplay style of the time the konami ninja turtle arcade games but it perseveres most of the original voice actors art style referances and characters the game almost can feel like crash course to somebody like me who doesnt know much about the series which really apreciate there are some really good tracks in this most of which were composed by the sonic mania composer the physical edition even came with pizza hut coupon for free personal pan pizza which is incredible ate pizza pretty much every time played this game this game is very worthy of sitting next to scott pilgrim as dotemu classics looking forward to the next beat em up game in this style that they adapted next ,1
psychonauts is one of the most unique 3rd person platformers ever made while the story and general creative direction are charming and still hold surprisingly well the game does sadly show its age in other ways ,0
a quirky platformer with brains pun intended ,0
 played before 2023 n this is one of my childhood games one of the ones that played as kid lot of think the quirkiness aged wonderfully and it is one of the few platformers that mixes combat and platforming super well although there is little bit of jank to it the story is unique with lot of memorable moments and characters and if you can get past some awkwardness and late game that drags on d certainly recommend this game ,1
mid gameplay with absolute peak comedy writing and acting,0
there was time where highly intelligent redditors would sing the praise of their favorite underrated gem and after playing it realized it an overrated turd the platforming and combat are lackluster leaving most of the games appeal to the wacky writing and characters ,1
beautiful world satisfying combat and sound design this is the only bethesda game that feels like it plays like an actual game its missing lot of what makes fallout great but its still fun fucking video game far harbor is also really cool ,1
sure this might not be as good as fallout 3 but that doesn mean it not still great fallout game still really loved my time with it and enjoyed the new systems they introduced in the game yes even weapon modification and base building n n disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 7 years ago ,0
if you hate this game you are little obsidioid chud,0
i have never more wanted refund of my time than with this game ,1
i dont even have anything substantial to say about f4 this game is ass,0
if these games werent fun and charming we might not be stuck in the age of unoriginal copy cat writing ,1
the greatest presentation and story in the series the pacing is slow to start but it helps to show the difference in nate life from the previous 3 games while showing off some great visuals the combat is expanded with better emphasis on stealth and the rope mechanic adds so much to this game in particular feeling like modern day indiana jones while there are some plot holes the character interaction and more grounded narrative spark intense emotion leading to an amazing and fulfilling ending always go back and forth between this game and n among thieves n as my favorite in the series ,1
uncharted has always been the frontrunner of cinematic presentation in video games but it always been backhanded compliment to say that this series defining quality is how well it imitates something it not like uncharted 3 before it uncharted 4 story more specifically its dedication to its characters elevates it as more than just movie with half baked video game on top ,1
fuck the puzzles,0
i think developers main goal with this game was to create spectacle amazing visuals and impressive story however with the gameplay not really interesting just another third person game ,1
always saw this as the weaker predecessor to two better games d rather be playing ocarina and link between worlds but know what it not half bad dungeon design music and combat hold up well and once you adjust to how arcade it feels comparatively to later zeldas it a pretty engrossing world to kill couple hours in ,0
objectively speaking maybe the best 2d zelda ever made n personally speaking beating it in week after spending six months on the original legend of zelda game was massive disappointment hate that they decided to indicate where dungeons were on the map ,0
it a fine game and it fun to play the dungeons and puzzles are well designed however feel this is game that strongly needs the nostalgia and you had to have been there factor to strike right for person which don have like most every other 2d zelda more for doing what this game did but better and the only reason see it top lists is because it was revolutionary which isn as good reason on its own to me still very solid game just not the absolute masterpiece often see it touted as ,1
faerie is the correct spelling don me ,1
enjoyed this game lot the ending was super cute and the music slaps as always especially love all the optional items you can get in this game it always feels worth it also one of the best intro ever n did end up using guide for some things because some items are hidden in such obscure places how do people even find those always have this problem with 2d zelda games so maybe it just me thing ,1
i have weird nostalgia about this game but don think ever really played it ,0
a very solid survival horror game that does an incredible job at having haunting atmosphere ,1
estava um pouco receoso desse jogo não ter envelhecido tão bem mas tirando os controles de tanque meio estranhos algumas coisas que hoje em dia parecem toscas acredito que envelheceu muito bem os gráficos de ps1 acabam ajudando bastante na atmosfera de terror gostei principalmente da trilha sonora dos puzzles que tem uma dificuldade boa que não é nem tão fácil nem tão difícil fato do jogo marcar no mapa onde você já foi ajuda muito os saves a quantidade de itens são bem justos em suma tirando os controles meio estranhos principalmente no combate nas lutas de chefe algumas outras coisinhas de menos esse jogo ainda vale muito pena ser jogado mesmo pra quem não jogou na época como eu ,0
while do appreciate the atmosphere that this game creates just couldn get past the janky controls ,1
light spoilers ,0
terrifying and wonderful really love this game whole lot and it just encapsulate almost everything that makes good horror don think the other games aged as well in design as felt that this was always the scariest one the dark world with fog the sound design the awkward angles from the pixels on the playstation it is just sooooo god the only issue have is the boss fights and some line deliveries with characters feeling one dimensional at times also the fact that lot of enemies are animals which feels weird to be chased around by monkey in this ,0
classic,1
i ll say this first and foremost n brawl mechanics are far from perfect everyone knows that n they were made to prey upon competitive players making mechanics to stop people from playing game the way they want is asinine and it why didn give this game more than four stars,1
coolest game ever when it came out as kid design choices limited its legacy but no other smash game has come close to having the content this game did ,0
it funny how fast this game went from being underrated because so many preferred melee to overrated because so many preferred this to smash 4 or smash ,0
get your realistic human beings out of my stupid cartoony fighting game and stop tripping ,0
hated this game when it came out still hate it cringe dialogue and writing ,0
this was the funniest shit ever when it came out its kinda unfunny now but at the time this was peak 2010s humor and fun campy gameplay,1
a bit too bold even for my taste the controls had to deal with were awful but that is purely emulator issue and gotta say that had to be the most difficult thing had to struggle with in this game as of to say the game itself is one linear and extremly easy other than that it ,0
ust plain game gives you many activities but really none of them have any depth to them gotta give props for the ost and them wrestling moves though 3 5 underrated my 20 are like this if you remove the cool swords and motorcycles want the track no more no more heroes to play at my wedding funeral and every social event in between no more heroes makes use of the wii motion controls better than any other game the combat is fun,1

que jogo lindo tem que ser muito fanboy pra achar que esse aqui não merecia melhor direção de arte história não é muita coisa mas eu achei sensacional talvez ele seja mais longo do que deveria mas não estragou experiência em nada,0
eu entendo como gostam disso é um assasins ceed única direfenca é que tem samurai sabia que sonystas gostavam tanto de japones com katana,0
i feel like this game goes on bit too long for its own good but it is pretty fun the writing does have problems but this isn a game played for its writing ,1
great story with exceptional combat and great overall world,1
i played so much of this game but have hard time remembering it really loved the atheist of the game and the tech is very impressive the combat is fun although takes bit to get going the story is pretty good not great though ,1
when first played this game had so much confidence thinking could play this in one sitting but ve been humbled one of the most interesting games ve completed as whole and wish can experience it blind again ,1
the music could be better,1
na superfície sifu apresenta modernização total levada as últimas consequências até então do estilo beat em up um jogo de luta divido em 5 fases que propõe vários inimigos chefes diferentes distribuídos entre elas para serem derrotados com diferencial de que jogador possui um talismã mágico que revive sempre que sofre uma lesão fatal em combate com desvantagem de que ele envelhece um número de anos com cada ressurreição acabará morrendo quando magia do talismã for usada em uma idade avançada ,0
 played before 2023 n excellent combat like really really excellent absolutely love it but that is pretty much the game it is kung fu scene not kung fu movie the levels look beautiful but you are doing the same gameplay loop in every single one with different background but it is still great even with that and really rewards you for getting good at the game ,1
i wish was better at this game ,1
i remembered beat it with warps,0
literal pegar tudo que deu certo melhorar ainda mais adicionar mais coisas novas tão incríveis quanto fez desse melhor mario 2d até agora pra mim fiz 100 amei ,0
an absolute classic and one of the all time best if not the all time best mario platformers ,1
it shocking how the mainline mario series trailblazed so hard for the platformer genre and games as whole in just its first few entries the level themes may seem standard now but it important that this was the n first n major game to do the whole grass desert water snow lava etc thing honestly contender for best nes game period and absolutely holds up the most n my only complaint is that upon replay the levels were lot shorter than remembered and wish some of the really cool power ups hammer suit weren so hidden ,0
the best part of smb3 is throwing hammer at boom boom and having it make million damage noises as it hits him making it sound like you ve harmed him so badly that you ve retroactively deleted his entire lineage from history ,0
this game is excellent suck at it but it so much fun assassin creed wishes it could do this ,0
dishonored n is one of the few games ,1
kojima você é um gênio n joguei dessa vez termino jogo mais tristonho do que antes ficou óbvio que se the boss não quisesse morrer snake nunca teria chance contra ela no mano mano que não existe lado certo no jogo que não somos os mocinhos que the boss assim como snake foi usada pelo seu próprio país ela não se sacrificou por algo benevolente mas sim foi usada de válvula de escape pra dissuasão continuar entre as potências dissuasão essa que em primeiro lugar nem mesmo deveria existir n she was true patriot n ela se doou de corpo alma pelo seu país mesmo com essa causa sendo imoral suja ela não fez isso cegamente ela mesma tem consciência na instabilidade do mundo que não existem heróis nem vilões nele nome dela vai carregar todo ódio infâmia dessa geração das próximas ela morreu mais de uma vez pelo seu país ninguém nunca vai saber disso ela tinha consciência de tudo isso n se isso não é ser patriota eu não sei que é n mas questionamento é valeu pena ,0
matei velho mudando data do console n mt pika,0
unique gameplay encounters and cool setting make this one of the better mgs titles in the series what thrill ,1
absolutely incredible every aspect of this game is incredible it takes itself serious enough to make good storyline and yet doesn take it self serious at all you can throw grenade into gator mouth and it will explode like cartoon the music is incredible the graphics hold up the r1 gimmic durring cutscenes can give you better feeling for snake can be hilarious or anything else every boss is incredible and unique the camoflage gimmick is very fun to mess around with and all the different ways you can play this games makes an easy 10 10 masterpiece on all fronts ,1
i swear kojima is actually psychic,1
very nice interactive movie drags little for what it is near the end ,0
the struggle and suffering to reach yourjourney or destination or goal worth,0
criou um gênero bom que poucos sabem fazer,0
journey is memorable experience while short making your way through world finding help along the way and eventually feeling more free than ever it a very charming game ,0
an excellent time the story is amazing the worlds are fantastic to go through and the feeling of growth is fantastic having the perfect pace imo 100 completion of this game is this experience honestly shines ultima weapon being highlight for me ,1
i don understand why this game exists but the ost slaps and cloud is in it so it good,0
h it confusing but this is the most grounded it ll get watching cloud strife interact with donald duck is insane enough this game has some goofy stuff but think it part of the charm the gameplay is pretty fun and while later entries improve 3d rpg combat is satisfying the story takes nice turn on the chosen one trope and while there are plenty of cliches and broken lines they re still kids cringe pra kct gaming tbh played playstation 4 final mix version was pleasantly surprised that this has not aged as badly the gameplay isn as smooth as some of the later entries but it still solid unlike some of the other games this has relativity simple story that help eases new people to the series n good game that does not need remake ,0
it a short game and all but had fun ,1
one of the most refreshing shooter campaigns ve played in long time and it 7 years old ,1
it wants to be half life 3 so bad,0
flawless movement and gunplay ,0
i revisited titanfall 2 years after playing it first on console and honestly had blast second time the solo campaign is probably one of my favorite of any modern fps games solid gameplay ,1
recomendadisimo,1
classic,1
doom my beloved,1
 played before 2023 n it is doom it is fun and revolutionized the world bringing fps to the forefront of our culture but it hasn aged that well the level design is complicated but horrible where everything is maze half the time you ll be running around an empty level looking for that one door that gives you yellow keycard with nothing in it and the music is more like butchered versions of famous metal songs the guns are great and the enemy design is rich and unique but really felt like they weren used to their full capability monster closets come from this game and really just aren interesting way to introduce majority of the enemies still pretty important to play and experience culture but definitely don think it has aged well ,1
esta god es medio viejo pero se sigue jugando bastante bien yo me lo termine papito jugo al doom ,0
a really solid anthology of mini gold era square rpgs lost to time now easily accessible via this hd2d remake live live is must play for anyone who enjoys square super nintendo output or anyone who wants jrpg that doesn play by the book ,1
this is collection of bunch of vignettes that all play with jrpg tropes in unique ways and for the most part found these stories really unique and entertaining this feels like the predecessor to chrono trigger in many ways so fans of that game will immediately see similarities it mostly very accessible game but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with certain chapters enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game but are particularly unconventional and could make for very weak first impression aside from that tho honestly loved this combat is big standout for me each encounter was like mini tactics battle with really fun grid system had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively and while it far from difficult game each battle had me engaged presentation is gorgeous with the hd 2d switch remake it a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original while some chapters are definitely weaker than others thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game and while won spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience this definitely deserves to be considered classic of the era right alongside ffvi and chrono trigger ,1
such creative and imaginative rpg from start to finish that d honestly place it among my favorites the amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at the battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people it was bit of blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all ,1
honestly there just wasn enough here to keep me engaged most of the chapters don encourage exploration the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact the space episode was the best one that got to and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points expect more from rpg even remasters of old classics if the combat is boring the story had better be engaging if the story is underwhelming want to be excited for each battle neither of these is the case for this game it truly overstayed its welcome ,1
the best soundtrack ve ever heard in video game ,1
played the game after watching the tv show which was probably not in favor of the game loved the show better but here loved how the gameplay was set up and lot more zombies than the show so it was fun very solid game ,1
gameplay intertwines with the narrative so perfectly simple game mechanically but so much greater than the sum of its parts beautiful story of quality that has seldom graced the gaming landscape true modern classic ,1
spectacular through and through,0
hbo did it better tbh,1
i loved this game joel and ellie relationship building throughout the game is so wonderful to see the world they build in this game is also so wonderful from the body horror of the infected to tommy town this game is masterpiece ,1
recomendado pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega no lo tenian todo atado,1
lixo jogo desgraçado n level design pavoroso dps da green hill zone n detestei foi uma das experiencias que mais me irritou nessa franquia inteira olha que eu joguei sonic 2006 ,0
a masterpiece of design more than it is an actually great game at the same time if you re competing with mario being able to have style and sound profile that burns itself into young mind is the only way to gain ground since it gonna be really hard to make up that distance mechanically ,0
fun if you re good and not alone ,1
well after 3k hours played must confess that m very addicted to this game but no matter what ll never learn how to play it on the controller ,0
the idea of the game good indeed but it may only be fun when you play with another player in local multiplayer n 7,1
has problems but still like it lot ,0
great ui beautiful graphics high quality voice acting that the franchise is known for and the biggest world map with incredible attention to detail condensed with so much batman history that it feels like the most complete love letter to the batman mythos yet an interesting reimagining of one of batman well known stories ,1
this makes you feel like batman,1
this game is too much of everything for its own good do not recommend it ,1
combat still fun but definitely less fun than 2 despite added complexity worth full playthrough if you like the series but the story falls short,0
kinda hated every new gimmick added to the formula none of it is nearly as good as the core combat with bayonetta ,0
in post elden ring post sekiro and hell even post devil may cry 5 world its hard to look at this game and really look forward to anything platinum games puts out next this was the one where they werent working for anybody but themselves ,0
bayonetta 3 ends up not only the worst but the most disappointing entry in the series ,0
the weakest bayonetta in the series the game feels like they mad half of it played dmc 5 and then tried really hard to force in similar passing the torch story without the same setup dmc had viola feels like joke character for the entire game and the ending fell very flat for me ,0
i really enjoyed this one the story is super interesting most characters are multi layered and more complex than they initially seem and how this game handles skills and thoughts is genius as most reviews for this game have said it really great that failing skill check does not necessarily mean you re now going through worse version of the game in some cases it even more fun route the politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media personally found myself more engrossed by the game study of the main character who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing huge amount of his character to be determined by the player normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character but this mixture of both helps lot in giving the player much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story n on that note the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane and they really don feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character once again this contributes heavily into making the player fit into the role playing aspect of this game more as their choices contribute to the type of cop they want to be ,0
there is too much you could say about this game less of game more of an interactive story with rpg elements and the story is amazing ,1
some of the most human feeling characters in games it well written well acted and generally very good well worth playthrough if it looks at all interesting ,1
i really loved this game and how it able to make you feel like harry through his inner voices the art style it so iconic and the music is so good can forget them little bit short but really worth it and you can replay it several times,1
i too stupid to get the most out of this game but absolutely appreciated how they personified the emotions traits and presented the rpg mechanic in such visual and eclectic way ,0
the song is called smell of the game because people who play this shit reek,0
if hear one more of you goofy motherfuckers say brisket or balling one more time am going to burst vein,0
scum dipper ,0
getting my shit kicked in rn but this is as fun as expected n amazing graphics really well thought out mechanics that will take me while to master banger soundtrack great characters and top tier visual presentation n cons the lobby system sucks ass and the season passes are so pricey imo ,0
the perfect arcade game another type of game they ll never make again ,1
i used to work in nursing home that had wii bowling league and team of 5 ladies who we actually recorded and submitted to national tournament n so shout out to dot and her perfect game and to the wonderful team in 2013 you all did great ,1
best game ever really love it slay,1
one of the best party games and solid single player game,1
enjoyed this one lot as big harry potter fan the developers have done an incredible job in making hogwarts make sense and feel lived in at the same time love all the elements of lore hinting back to parts of the books whilst still feeling new some of the characters were very likeable and liked the three main subplots the main story was decent too with some dramatic and emotional moments combat is lot of fun too and flying is an awesome mechanic ,1
had lot of fun playing this ngl running around hogwarts was dream come true sadly has pretty weak ending and some rough edges but enjoyed almost the entire experience and will play again at some point,0
weirdest game ve played in awhile where at first was thinking it was possible goty then actually digging into the game you saw them just repeat everything ton of times over and over n what mindless slog,0
an incredible entry to the harry potter world it such refreshing game an interesting story would rather have bully esque focusing more on being student but still it a nice game ,1
such mess finished it just because don like to leave stuff halfway through can see all the money they had put into this game and the designers and 3d modelers hard work but it simply does not pay off this is just bunch of nice assets awkwardly put together the fighting system works and seems interesting at the beginning but by the end it is barely enjoyable spamming skills and rolling around from hundreds of enemies to what to get new pair of the same looking rounded glasses no no no we still do not get that this is harry potter inspired game 33 copies of the same old black cloak same thing with exploring there simply no reason to explore the giant territory of non interesting copy paste bandit and goblin camps stupid forest that spread across the highlands that looks exactly the same at any point of your destination apart from the small part to the south to get bunch of decorative pieces to be honest could go on and brag about every aspect of it from the upgrade system and the way you progress through it to the story arghhhh but this game does not deserve any kind of critique written toward it ,0
completed to fulfill childhood dream and it genuinely fun racing grand prix mode can be infuriating if you re trying to get star ratings though,1
the worst mario kart the sort of thing reprobate would come up with for fun motion controls can die ,0
skill issue,0
it the wii one everyone played this one it a fun mario kart don really like the motion controls but it does have funky kong funky music too ,1
i used to deeply dislike mario kart wii the controls felt unresponsive and wrong and the item balancing seemed nonexistent to me ,0
the worst of the modern re games but still fun ,1
got soft locked and do not wish to continue the game this game is bad man compared to re2 remake the level design is so bare bones the main threat nemesis only chases you in the first 30 minutes of the game and thats it the new dodge mechanic is janky and half baked idk it ,0
ust bad go play the original not this great game too short and the audio is kinda fucked up but other than that the game is amazing looks really bad compared to re2 harcamışlar oyunu ,0
unpacking is great game in bursts that is really amazing showcase of environmental story telling however this strength also becomes it weakness as it gets incredibly repetitive putting away the same objects in new obtuse locations,0
esse jogo é incrível para relaxar consegue trazer um sentimento de paz maravilhoso n por mais que simples ele é ótimo na sua proposta não tem pontos negativos que atrapalhem experiência n história por mais que simples consegue emocionar os jogadores mais atenciosos seus detalhes mensagens por trás ,0
i unpacked things it does the job well,1
foi pequeno demais mas gostei de fazer algo que não faço irl arrumar quarto,0
well this is not my piece of cake,1
i really enjoyed the gentle environmental storytelling here so many details that can be inferred from what items stick around between moves and which ones fall behind which in turn informs how you choose to sort and decorate these rooms making the practical layout line up as best as possible with your understanding of the protagonist and how they use the space there some really lovely stuff here about how as we grow we both keep some parts of ourself whilst shedding others and how moving home can be moment that brings these changes into focus ,0
good one,1

my parents were oddly strict about me getting gtaiv so while was waiting for my first proper gta experience managed to wrangle them into line just in time for red dead release ,0
as long time tales fan had high hopes for this game and must say that while there are good highs to the experience such as the combat there are also awful lows the 3rd act of the game the result is slightly above average game if you re here for the combat you ll have fantastic time even though it can get repetitive at times it flashy fluid and the best the series has ever been this is only made better by the fantastic soundtrack honestly did not mind listening to the same battle tracks for the duration of my almost 60 hour journey it that good ,1
i want to start this by saying that really n desperately n wanted to like this game genuinely was so excited to start it as m quite fan of the series ,1
the ending wasðÿ ðÿ ,0
summary great gameplay god awful story it a nice enough game to play despite how dull the story and characters are up until it faceplants during the final act n beating things up is fun enough to where think most people forgave the flaws as cursory look at the reviews here seems to show but just can overlook all the issues it has ,0
gameplay is some of the best tales has seen so far however the story and characters turned me off more so than other tales games made it right to the n spoilers n false ending lost interest after ,0
good but chapter 2 is bettar ,1
pretty great,1
i went to play blind and surprised myself unique gameplay with striking and charismatic characters with great comedy scenes ,1
pretty damn good n pretty damn scary n hope my wife is okay,0

what blast to play m sure if played it 10 years ago when it came out would ve thought it was super cheesy quick time events crazy camera angles tumbling all over the place scripted falls fails but enjoyed it lot the story sucks but the controls combat were super fun it nice to come back to something that was soo cliche during the release it nostalgic ,0
pretty good gameplay and exploration but the story and some of the situations you get yourself in are so unbelievably cheesy that it could break the immersion,0
zerei 100 do modo história com 34 horas n é sim um bom jogo mas não passa disso,0
truly engaging story and atmosphere with decent combat and stealth mechanics and memorable yet predictable characters ,1
un more of the same che però riperfeziona quello che il predecessore ha cercato di fare in ambito gameplay livelli sono di gran lunga più divertenti i power up sfruttati meglio il completismo è di gran lunga meno tedioso in generale ho preferito di più tamosfera di questo capitolo ,0
it feels less like sequel and more like dlc to an already great game nonetheless galaxy 2 is pretty good just not as good as the og,1
just as good as the original and like the cloud power up hate the introduction to shadow mario tho ,0
its mario galaxy but more of it and this time with yoshi the hub world got downgrade this time but it more than makes up for it with the increase in difficulty as well as n the addition of yoshi one shotting the final world is one of the best experiences that 3d mario can provide ,0
donkey kong country 1 is good it not the best in the series but it really sets up the sequels to be amazing games ,1
once you look past the technological achievement you end up with fun little game that has ton of flaws but still has lot of charm ,1
a great platformer both to play and look at it shocking how such early 3d cgi holds up and it doesn feel like it should be possible but it totally does there is nice straight forwardness to this game level design where it doesn pull many punches but doesn pull cheap tricks either the factory and jungle levels are cool minecart levels can be bit too strict the boss fights are generally uninspired and the low part of the game but the final boss is great the music is awesome too ,1
this is the first game played on my ps5 and really liked it lot it a pretty creative visual novel with great directing and inventive stories it not the most complex game out there but totally recommend it ,1
what remained was bunch of melancholic stories about the finch family ,1
it was good game wanted to play short game and this was only around 3 hours long think the story was melancholic and surprisingly good ,1
i ve been playing this series on and off since the original ps2 demo that came with devil may cry 3 without the online component available here in europe it was kinda ok but forgettable playing it solo moving onto the psp releases of freedom freedom 2 and unite where my friends and would all get together to play it wireless on our psps was an absolute blast and ve been huge fan ever since ,1
fun but too much it a miracle how this runs on switch ,1
my favorite fifth gen game worth every cent the wirebug system makes for speedy and interesting battles against the familiar and new monsters do miss the old mounting system that doesn detract enough from my enjoyment to lower the score though ,1

uma excelente sequência do primeiro,1
i felt like neo twewy desperately wants to get out of its own way and be its own game but it simply can pull it off n nearly everything in the game is reference to its predecessor ,0
this game is so awesome passion project for sure so much detail and effort poured into every crevice of this game it absurd not perfect but enjoyed it so much it deserves 10 gameplay is such huge improvement over the last game to me actually enjoyed the combat in this game all the characters have my heart esp rindo fret and shoka please play this ,1
it a great sequel did whole writeup where expressed my feelings broadly but also liked played this game ,1
the first game meant lot to me in so many ways that was nervous about approaching the sequel what if the sequel was cringe wouldn ,0
olor the first game as kind of cringe maybe neku really would have been an unbearable protagonist instead of the kind of person who learns and grows and that means et,0
ately the ways this game is mediocre do,0
t taint the first game the spirit shines through it just falls apart in execution with clunky pacing make dumb decisions so you can revisit them later painful combat my rsi my different flavor of pin evolutions tin pin slammer and technical issues all over the map is cancel is accept serious lag issues n at least we got high quality soundtrack this time the music still rules ,0
i didn think d like it as much as did ngl,1
o salto de evolução entre assassin creed 1 são é sobre um gigantesco abismo finalmente temos um bom sistema de escalada apesar de ele ser pouco polido às vezes temls um combate interessante apesar de também ter suas limitações no geral stelth existe para evitar um combate pouco inventivo onde você pode optar por um counter hitkill com as hiden blades esquivar torcer para acertar hitkill ou pode passar 10 minutos batendo contra arma do inimigo não tenho nostalgia com este jogo então reconheço suas qualidades evoluções mas também suas limitações n não há muito que fazer no mundo aberto combate fica cansativo o stelth pouco se faz importante usado em missões bem repetirivas 90 das vezes matar um inimigo na beira de um telhado fará ele cair 60 das vezes você cai junto se atacar correndo não é um grande problemão mas me chateia bastante principalmente porque geralmente você ataca correndo ,0
i was blown away by the improvements made in assassin creed ii the game graphics were stunning and the new setting of renaissance era italy was beautifully recreated the gameplay was smoother than its predecessor with more intuitive control scheme that made free running and combat more satisfying also appreciated the addition of wide variety of weapons and upgrades allowing for more personalized gameplay ,1
don wanna debate these games sorry matthew ,0
a sequel which just blew everyone expectations out the water don think ve ever been as engaged with setting and protagonist as have with italy and ezio ,0
i remember liking this less than 1,1
this is game can see why people like it but see so may problems with this one let me talk positive first the story in this game is really intrging with arven and team star and while not the best pokemon soundtrack it has it bangers like every team star theme now onto the negatives the game is not well optimized for the switch at all we have so many problmes both old and new as well as it overheating my switch recently the gym test and raiding team bases are boring and monotonous the titan bosses are joke with them being piss easy like the idea of an open world pokemon game but this game isn that at all there is an order to do things and even then you have to defeat team star bases to traverse further in the region the final battle is scrippted and don want that in pokemon game can understand why people like this game and think it better then sword and shield but this is not huge step up from those games ,0
la puntuación viene por el rendimiento técnico del juego que parece yo jugando un partido de futbol 7 en mitad de agosto,0
i ve never had such fun with pokemon game in long time thoroughly enjoyed the exploration and trying to catch them all aspects of the game the storylines were fun in their own rights as well victory road is exactly what it is and there nothing wrong with that starfall street dragged on but appreciated the themes and backstory of team star they have the best battle osts in the game short of the actual final boss and path of legends was very sweet and relatable it made me like arvan which is impressive after his introduction in the game could even go back to it and still enjoy it its that good for all its faults if you enjoy pokemon at all you don want to miss out on this one,1
reak has made the worst one ever four times in row now closest ive ever been to completing pokedex 2 3 starters suck and while it is open world there is very strict level for each area so you still have to figure out the right progression path on your own crashes lot but it has pikachu so its okey,0

when the space is dead,0
one of the best sci fi horror shooters ever made no wonder there was remake ,1
 played before 2023 n really good game but the remake just points out the flaws few things feel dated especially with some levels and character choices but the gameplay is still amazing it took what re4 did and created something unique and created unique environment the influences of event horizon and alien are obvious and it kickstarted well beloved franchise but honestly there is no reason to play this game just play the remake unless you really need more dead space and you want to see the slight changes ,1
fun game with fun power ups just wish these new super mario bros games used different sounds from game to game this one feels lot different than the wii one as far as the levels go but it sounds exactly the same so it tricks my brain into it feeling even less standout than it already is this scratched my mario itch though so good job guys who made this ,0
laughed til cried griefing my friends both accidentally and intentionally please play with friends it so much better,0
can say remember too much about this one but it started war and now we will never get another 2d mario game again thanks nintendo ,1
it still not mind blowing but it kinda insane how much of glowup this is compared to what we got in the good old days and how well it still holds up in general,1
 played before 2023 n this game is definitely amazing it might be lacking in lot of aspects but that is on purpose with some of the best scaled boss fights around this was 1 1 graphical update of the game and nothing else something wish more remakes did everyone should play this game ,1
the intentionally empty open world creates an atmosphere unmatched in any game this is the first strand like game the lack of dopamine drip collectables makes it so the player can focus on appreciating the world for what it is instead of having to focus on picking up all the garbage on the ground to level up your fart cannon 0 5 more damage ,0

horizon forbidden west é um jogo bom mas na minha opinião inferior ao primeiro acho que entrei muito hypado pra jogar ele acabei me decepcionando não pelo fato dele ser ruim sim pelo fato de esperar um jogo fenomenal tem muito mais pontos positivos principalmente os gráficos do que negativos feliz por ter esperado pra jogar game pela assinatura da plus nessa eu sinto que acertei em esperar,0
rip lance,0
 played before 2023 n every single issue had with the original game is fantastic and wonderful love it the gameplay is better the soundtrack is better the story is better and the graphics are better everything about this game is amazing and loved the 80 hours had in it the enemies are super cool and unique you get way more control of build and what you want to focus on the world is much more fleshed out with unique areas and overall think this is one of the best games out there ,1
it a fun metroidvania it holds your hand bit and is fun to play while being very pretty game but it didn leave much of an impact on me ,1
esse jogo é exemplo de um jogo que se beneficiaria de mecânicas mais aprofundadas apesar de continuar sendo um jogo bom ,1
i would ve liked it but it basically requires walkthrough open at all times to progress and d rather not play the game at all than play it with walkthrough ,0
i hated this game the story was great the music was wonderful the art design was great but the gameplay was clunky and infuriating did finish it yes did wish hadn also yes ,1
so fucking pretty,0
world tendency gives me unneeded anxiety,0
not the best souls game but as the very first in the genre it pretty dang good short but good didn mind the healing system as much after getting past the tower knight don give up ,1

i expected so much of this but its not bad at all,0
antes da review vale ressaltar que peguei jogo gratuitamente na epic games n jogo excelente personagens muito bons uma história imersiva em 100 do tempo uma espécie de plot muito bom nos últimos 20 do jogo únicos defeitos que posso dizer aqui é ia burra a gameplay um pouco repetitiva pra um jogo com 16 horas pra zerar recomendo 100 ,1
bom mas repetitivo curti história ,0
too linear and repetitive for me but loved the vibe and atmosphere ,1
a plague tale é uma aventura sobre dois irmãos durante período da peste jogo segue base do estilo narrativo com uma gameplay simples porém funcional dando foco principalmente em sua história comentando brevemente sobre jogabilidade plague tale não possui mecânicas refinadas ou grandes listas de habilidades diversas jogo resolve usar uma abordagem mais simples com apenas uma arma alguns tipos de munições que em suma maioria é utilizada de maneira pontual ao decorrer da jogatina gameplay simples relativamente repetitiva não é um problema aqui visto que jogo possui um enredo rico em detalhes que consegue desenvolver sua premissa com perfeição em um misto de momentos de ação angústia nervosismo fúria obra consegue entregar aquilo que promete muito mais conseguindo explicar os pontos que foram propostos serem explicados ao mesmo tempo que deixa pontas soltas para sua sequência plague tale requiem,0
bored me but the game looked great played nicely,1
pretty cool game like the updated looks since they fit really well with the game theme and the mario enemies overall it is delightful zelda and recommendable introduction to some of the older titles which require more backtracking and exploring every corner of the map to advance ,1
great update to one of my favourite childhood games only held back by its performance ,1
i liked this one but the dungeons felt kind of underwhelming and forgettable the puzzles were mostly fun but just felt they lacked any independent themes usually can recall few standout dungeons from each game but for this one can say can differentiate them and just played it through over the last few days ,0
artistically love this game the island setting is really refreshing and koholint is so lovely to just exist in the dreamlike nature of the narrative is super different for zelda and the way it all wraps up at the end is so nice finally meeting the wind fish waking up hearing marin song beautiful and the visual style oh my god adore how this game looks so much want every game to look like this it is so so full of charm and colour and personality give me mario game that looks like this give me pokemon game that looks like this give me fuckin gta game that looks like this genuinely what would love more than anything else in the world is for the zelda series after tears of the kingdom to come back to this style for the next mainline game don just keep this relegated to remakes if you do oracle of seasons ages give me full on original top down open world game with this visual style drop me in place as beautiful and mysterious as koholint tell me very little and let me discover it all on my own ,1
in this first game the story and switching between present day circa 2007 and the past set in the crusade era holy land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired that isn to say the game is the worst thing ever but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it tough to recommend the parkour system is very cool and has lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations scaling towers and doing leaps of faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points there are many other menial side missions that while not lacking in variety are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly play it if you re curious as some of the stealth is fun and little more low key compared to later entires in the series but don be surprised if it gets dull very quickly ,0
sinceramente eu não curti sei que é primeiro jogo que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho mas caramba é torturante escalar combate não tem diversidade nenhuma o protagonista apesar de interessante não tem quase nada de carisma sempre falando em tom neutro sem expressar emoção n para um início mesmo levando em conta as limitações ainda é bem fraco é só ver que prince of persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas mas não é que acontece basicamente jogo não tem stealth isso matou graça de muitas missões pois você basicamente chega no inimigo esfaqueia depois aperta botão para disfarçar me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos se eu falhasse ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá os guardas ficavam em alerta dificultando conseguir assassinar alvo sem falhar as vezes os npcs os loucos simplesmente me empurravam eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava missão eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que não fosse obrigado fazer para seguir com as principais que são todas praticamente iguais nada recompensadoras ,0
as someone who played assassin creed back in the day have to say that had mixed feelings about it on the one hand appreciated the game unique setting and storyline which offered fresh take on the action adventure genre the game visuals were also impressive for their time with richly detailed environments and realistic character animations ,1
weird nostalgia for this one remember my dad used to laugh when mowed the pilgrims over with my horse ,0
mortal wounds are an awful mechanic but otherwise this is easily the most straight up fun ve had so far with an rgg game ,0
judge man takes judgement into his own hands just wish tailing missions werent thing fun story and character though rggs understands why people play their games ,0
yakuza in all but name where judgment excels is in its story even the best yakuza entries inevitably devolve into flurry of preposterous plot reveals and ripped off shirts but judgment just about manages to maintain narrative coherence right up to the end credits delivering wholly satisfying and unrelentingly grim murder mystery that kept me guessing until the end d happily slot judgment into my list of essential video game stories to be experienced up there with the likes of broken sword grim fandango silent hill 2 shattered memories the longest journey max payne 2 and the last guardian the story is that good ,0
análise de judgment um spin off da franquia yakuza que nós apresenta um novo protagonista chamado ichiban novos personagens muito bens conteúdos kaito cof cof executar uma história muito acima de grande parte dos yakuza que até então 0 foi meu favorito contudo jogo está muito bem otimizado no series tem uma gameplay divertida pra caramba história cativante emocional uma soundtrack muito gostosa de ouvir minha opinião sobre jogo melhor que todos os yakuzas parabéns rgg,0
this game isn bad just couldn get into it for whatever reason ,0
amazing storyline with well written characters ryu ga gotoku studio does it again gameplay feel the same but it good as it is the city is alive as always with lots of great side quest and mini games ,1
res go ki da japanee ,0
never played it in its prime but can only imagine how awesome the mp must have been in full lobbies campaign is great zombies is good but overrated,1
the best cod banging campaign unreal multiplayer the height of zombies they ve never nailed it better than this ,1
one of the most iconic cod games and thats for good reason the amount of effort poured into making this game is immeasurable ,1
campaign was eh zombies however slaps ,0
this one is really fun time the tech is the most impressive thing about it portals that are secretly 2 second loading screens super detailed textures and animations all pop here really like the movement in the game especially when it just gives you big area and says go fast ,1
 ooh this looks pretty the game,1
this game has some real crungo writing but the combat platforming is really inganging and the seamless rift system is cool ,1
the writing feels phoned in much of the time the music is unmemorable and the game is shorter than d have liked but other than that liked it the people at insomniac know how to make fun games ,1
r rift apart looks absolutely stunning and has very fun and fluid combat with an amazing lineup of weapons my favourites being the enforcer blackhole storm and cold snap the haptic feedback with the weapons all feel great especially with the enforcer always love good shotgun there lots of neat level designs and environments that caught me off guard and were very enjoyable to play the story was entertaining enough but is forgettable the best parts involving the conflicts between the main villains and gets quite funny at times after being quite critical on future era think this is definitely step forward for the ratchet clank franchise ,1
it good to see sony classic franchises being brought back after the original game remake knew something was coming along and was right we get brand new next gen exclusive ratchet clank game without the baggage of the ps4 holding it down the franchise returns to its familiar roots which are both good and bad and ll explain why ,0
desptie being n pokemon black n the pokeopn on the box is white n that sucks,0
this game is pretty cool d love to play past the second gym someday,1
when first heard about gen 3 imagined that it was gonna look like this gen 5 is exactly what always wanted pokemon to be ,1
it is one of the best games in the series by far and just about everything works about it same thing for white ,1
fun for while,1
a fun entertaining little time that surprisingly has lot of replay value in its multiple endings but also zero replay value in that once you ve seen everything that is indeed pretty much it still absolutely worth play imo its very charming and subvertive to lot of gamer tropes and very entertaining as result definitely one of the games where once finished it makes you wanna see other people play it to see what routes they go down first ,1
forgot how meaningful most of this game actually was felt full of choices almost none of which felt like filler and never felt like it overcompensated the player most of its themes from critiquing game design and linking it to topics such as existentialism and capitalism always felt unique and tasteful ,1
managed to 100 this in less than two hours personal record for me will play this game once every couple years for the rest of my life it is just so damn good ,0
2023 the year we stop pretending this is any good,0
this game is somehow 37 years old which is crazy because without guide m sure that how long it would take someone to beat it,0
i love completing an uchikoshi game with 3 full pages of notes love busting out my little notepad and collecting clues love scouring every area for secret details love aiba ,1
what the hell,0
dogs are awesome oh and this is one of the best games of all time ,1
sim os personagens história são legais mas ainda assim mistura quebra cabeça com aventura 2 gêneros que não gosto muito então talvez culpa foi minha por não gostar tanto ,0
an excellent game ,1
missle the dog is in this game that all you need to know to get you to play it,0
ghost trick é facilmente um dos melhores jogos de ds não bastando sua gameplay única diversificada com touch cada puzzle é único sua narrativa contextualiza de forma genial suas ghost tricks seu cast principal é perfeito não só tem uma construção boa pro seu propósito como transmitem vida com ajuda das animações fabulosas até mesmo extravagantes que tornam satisfatório cada momento que você não está no controle ouso dizer ainda que ign está errada linearidade da obra torna crível funcional no meio de tudo que engloba não é um defeito n trilha sonora arrebenta composições extremamente boas para seus momentos efeitos sonoros de alta qualidade n texto é muito bom sabendo que nenhuma explicação seria boa suficiente foca na sua temática de morte arrependimento destino causa consequência ao invés de se demorar com origem do seu poder ainda sim sua explicação é aceitável se torna um bom recurso de roteiro até que se prove contrário é passível de não ter furos de roteiro ou pontas soltas sendo gratificante cada mistério resolvido inserido construção para grand finale não poderia ser melhor,0
pretty wild that this was made by the same people as ace attorney considering that ace attorney sucks and this rocks ,0
it is the most alrightest modern dragon quest m glad finally saw it through in my quest to beat all the dragon quests it the top of the middle of the pack and great place to start ,1
epic adventure,0
lo pude jugar cuando me rostice la pierna no podia ir trabajar por una semana me hizo olvidar que cuando daba un paso mi pierna se desintegraba nada que ver la reseña pero bueno que tal todo bien yo maso pero al menos ya se me curo la pierna,0
i feel like have to get myself into the certain mindset where can enjoy dragon quest after playing more intense jrpgs for while had fun with this but the plot of this game especially the postgame time travel stuff felt incredibly mishandled and actually undid what small part of this story where the protagonist loses and veronica sacrifices herself even though wasn much of fan of this game it did encourage me to play the others,0
cozy jrpg haven played any other dq games but this was really nice experience although the formula is simple it made interesting by the amount of skills and upgrades the characters would ve never met but now we ve got full party sure hope we don have to fight god ,0
so what the hell is act 3 ,0
i haven technically completed it yet the final boss is super fucking hard ,0
i know most folks are kinda sick of hearing people praise this game nowadays but still that for reason it still masterpiece ,1
very good game but was dumb as fuck and thought this was the first paper mario game,0
the statue with the face of the canva liberté guidant le peuple love that statue n could say lot but just believe me it ,0

efinitely wish liked this game more but can enjoy it as much as others aqui é onde mais maior acerta porque é uma melhoria muito grande do que primeiro jogo da franquia tinha traz ainda uma continuação da história ainda mais interessante novas mecânicas inimigos pluzzes enfim é um jogo incrivel um tanto frente dos jogos da sua época tal como comenté en la n reseña del anterior n god of war tiene un sistema de pelea que se hace repetitivo aburrido con el paso de las horas en este juego se han intensificado la falta de novedades en la jugabilidad se han recoloreado las habilidades de kratos aunque no aporten algo muy distinto la experiencia del primero en cuanto historia me ha dejado bastante frío es un pelín mejor que la del primer juego pero nada del otro mundo sigue pecando de falta de complejidad he notado hasta un exceso de puzzles con mecánicas parecidas otra vez al primer juego am what the gods have made me ,1
i commander shepard and this is my favorite game on the citadel ,1
i love that the plot is getting all your cool alien friends together want new mass effect that has no suicide mission at the end where you get to hang out with your cool alien friends,0
love this game for allowing me to change my stupid character from 1 to look better it excellent this game taught me how to graft ,1
 played before 2023 n as someone who doesn really enjoy sci fi settings or rpgs this is one of my favorite games of all time everything good about the first game is still there the combat has been streamlined and improved and you have so many companions with their own unique aspects and quests this game companion system is absolutely top tier with emotional stories loyalty and consequences for your choices that haven seen in any other game can talk much more about this without spoiling it but god damn it is good am shocked at how much enjoyed this game as only played it because wanted to speedrun it did not expect to enjoy it so much casually ,1
there a lot of third person shooter gameplay in this role playing game very strange ,0
if have to listen to levitating one more god damn time,0
i hate videogames,0
car diversity is amazing despite map is so large urban sites are so restricted and the whole city is soulles so there is no traffic at all however events are so various and the handling is so smooth ,0
i am still salty that this was sold as separate game and wasn just the opening mission to phantom pain ,0
the most fun part of this game is learning all the paths through the relatively small map and using those new routes to get ranks in all the missions ,0
weirdly more consistent video game than the phantom pain,0
this game unfortunately didn live up to my expectations still good none the less ,1
it good great even but actually wanted to fight some of those alien commanders suda,1
suda saw that travis would only be mii fighter in smash ultimate and took that personally,0
graphic design is my passion the video game,1
i a bit mixed on this one while the good parts are great the game also suffers in few areas really like the combat in this one and new mechanics like the mech thing are really cool and it fun to stack damage on enemies ,1
great game awful optimization n putting aside the obvious graphical and level design mess n the game for some reason launches steam vr whenever turn it on the vsynch doesnt work durring cutscenes for some reason the game also crashed multiple times and the fact that it has no auto save meant lost tons of progress also the fans on my pc turn so fast that feel like its gonna take off which could be potential risk of hardware damage n but still cant hate on it too much since the core game is great it feels like everything grasshopper and suda had been working towards since the first game,0
the open world somehow felt more bland than the original wii version of santa destroy and you could make far more money refighting bosses at your home as opposed to doing the odd jobs around the map other than however pretty alright no more heroes game personally feel that 2 was better ,0
one of the best 3d platformers ever imo,1
picking up hundreds of collectables is tedious and awful but if you inject the right amount of nostalgia into it then m willing to put up with anything also the quiz at the end is legitimately fun and will not let anyone tell me otherwise ,1
sort of perfected the collect thon formula for me at least think its my favourite n64 platformer obviously it owes everything to mario 64 but feel this just expanded that formula and used the basis for loads of really creative level designs and use of music ,1
an awesome trip down playstation memory lane hunting down all of the museum artifacts and seeking out game references was amazing music was too catchy and stuck in my head for days after finishing ,1
it a decent time waster and m enough of nerd to get lot of the references they made but this game did not feel like it had much substance ,0
if sony wanted to show the capabilities of the new dualsense controller they easily could ve done 5 minute guide which gives you the new features and how you can use them but instead they went the extra mile and made very fun yet simple game which is both informative and celebration of playstation history of their technology and game series with the levels being themed around different parts of the console and level design being very creative as to how they can show off the new features this makes for one of the most memorable tech demos just due to how refreshing it is with the ways it teaches you about the ps5 ,1
all of these pretentious mfs actin like this is the best cod no it aint ,1
the last good cod nuff said ,1
helllll yeah,0
best cod and that not just nostalgia talking campaign multiplayer league play and zombies were all great,1
the dihareeha encrusted diaper of the legend of zelda franchise,0
fun zelda game just hated some parts and the imprisoned sucks,0
the second zelda game ve beaten and my first 3d zelda beaten this game is amazing the new joystick controls work well mostly and the game itself is super fun to play the puzzles are fun the story is great origin story for the series groose the music is amazing definitely give this one play even if it just to see lord groose character development ,1
n merece hate,0
zelda month chronological order,1
awesome game if there were just one mega man entry in the whole franchise had to recommend to someone it would be this one even though it isn my favorite game just because of how rock solid and consistent the entire experience is ,1
só não consigo dar uma nota maior porque tem outros melhores ,0
truly the most replayable game ever when you know all the optimal routes and learn enough for minimal backtracking truly an amazing game,1
poucos problemas gameplay absurda de boa ,0
in some aspects think this game is little overrated but in lot of other aspects think it holds up just as much as people say designwise this game is fantastic with the level design and game control being top notch for the super nintendo m not the biggest fan of the snes sound chip so the ost was pretty big miss for me personally but the songs are indeed well composed liked this game enough to 100 it so take with that as you will one of the classics on the snes for sure ,1
the kind of game thought would love on paper but once started playing just kinda lost interest fairly quickly people who completed it all say its amazing and might go back one day but ive tried twice now and both times just dropped it after about 3 hours ,1
fun but empty just like ocean,1
great game,1
easily one of the best survival games available the cycle of finding new materials and blueprints and bringing them back to base to build something better to go exploring with provides constant stream of good chemicals in the brain only issue may be the lack of direction near the mid late period as well as the repeated back tracking when descending deeper but when look at the stars m reminded of god infinite love and beauty extends to the high heavens not just earth can sinner be welcome to heaven can has eternal salvation is for me ,0
as they become increasingly few and far between my appreciation of games that totally grab your brain and won let go deepens in tandem ,1
 played before 2023 n loved this game the setting is unique and the main character is one of my favorite in games selene is such cool determined character and really loved the combat and effects this was really the first next gen game played on the ps5 and it didn disappoint my main issue is that it is roguelike but it doesn have any replabilitiy really didn feel any reason to go back through this game and only came back after my initial playthrough for the dlc which definitely helps me want to replay through it but you can really control or change builds to have drastically different play styles you re still dodging and shooting with an active reload for the most part and that is it with the variety coming from the enemies and biomes hope we get sequel that turns it into true roguelike letting me focus on melee or dashing or tanking shots or being glass cannon or something to add more variety that this game needed ,0
muito muito bom antes de jogar returnal já havia visto um vídeo cheio de spoilers lido diversas críticas do jogo mas mesmo assim experiência foi fantástica descobrir os mistérios dos biomas entender helios por conseguinte quem é protagonista são questões criadas através do gameplay com maestria ,0
i remember playing this with friends lot and it very nostalgic for me the disc eventually stopped playing few minutes into the game but it was loved ,1
i will never forgive this game for starting the whole wii wii mario blandness era new super mario bros ds was fun unique and creative this one makes me shudder in disgust because it was the first of what would be three new super mario bros sequels it represents everything wrong with the boring age of mario games in the late 2000s early 2010s ,0
it very in character for 2d mario to pump out something that actually super good then immediately ruin it by taking inspiration from some of my least favorite places in the franchise,1
really nice character writing and worldbuilding only wish it was longer so the characters could be fleshed out more have yet to play the additional content so it could fix this complaint,0
citizen sleeper n has dense sometimes even suffocating atmosphere one full of textures the sleeper synthetic skin the ink black color and consistency of space sensations the cold floor and the annoying flickering of the lights colors in the outlandish outfits of the characters smells and tastes the spiciness and rich flavour of emphir fungus sounds the mechanical whirring and the bleep bloop ,0
satisfying and hopeful lovely ,1
a rare game that seamlessly melds the core game mechanic into rich world built on layers of narrative and some killer art and sound spend 5 minutes on n the eye n and it ll feel like you ve lived your whole sleeper life there spend 1 hour on n the eye n and for all it rusted containers failing life support and crushing spiraling n existence n you ll want to call it home ,0
with art by guillaume singelin and music and sound design by amos roddy gareth damian martin n citizen sleeper n is genuinely gorgeous and rich game that gently reminds you that staying still is not always the best option even if you manage to pull yourself or get pulled into better place it also gently compels you to think about those moments in your life where sacrifices or compromises had to be made and how the choice to make them wasn always voluntary n nor was it always yours to make in the first place ,1
i feel the mechanical nakedness of this game is both blessing and curse at first was worried that it would hurt immersion but the great characters and fantastic ambience music design dragged me fully in after the first 20 or so minutes even found that the nakedness of the system made you really feel what your impact in the world is and really highlighted the sense of player agency which is plentiful in this game ,0
eine öde story gameplay welches deine zeit verschwendet eine schwache auswahl an minigames und viele technische probleme mit dem remaster machen es zu einem yakuza titel welcher wirklich nur für fans genießbar ist ,0
i remember hearing from people that this was one of the weakest entries in the series and like eh nah don see it liked the okinawa vibes too much to really dislike this the pacing for the plot was definitely little weird but it still had its cool moments that enjoyed the enemies definitely do block bit too much tho ,1
super wacky goofy fun times yes,0
gm_construct bizim üniye benziyo,0
this game isn that fun to me anymore for the same reason that playing with legos isn that fun to me anymore didn stop me from somehow sinking over 800 hours into it when was younger though ,0
its pretty good single player fps heard lot of good stuff but it doesn really do anything special both in terms of narrative and gameplay ,1
decent enough single player fps doesnâ do anything too special but nothing stands out as bad ,0
my second fave wolfenstein after return first game bought when got my ps4 and it was jaw dropping just dope console shooter ,0
wish could play more from this series but this is genuinely so scary can ðÿ xadðÿ xadðÿ xadðÿ xad was made for baby games,0
i think it was too long sometimes but worth experience,1
there a part where you are trying to avoid capture and are supposed to back track to an escape helicopter you are intercepted by big blockade around the whole area but with the helicopter there far back in the distance knew this was supposed to be one of the goats with choosing your own path so used my elder scrolls platforming skills to jank around one of the barriers and felt satisfied on attaining what knew must be difficult branch in the story ,0
in more combative place in my life was vocally against this game and told lots of people about this view point someone at the time rebuked me with shut up and eat your fucking vegetables and honestly they kinda had point ,0
do you have single fact to back that up ,0
i find myself in the odd position of struggling to write about n deus ex n the game felt longer than it actually was engrossing in way haven really experienced d consider myself good fan of immersive sims and it isn hard to see why this is considered as essential as it is n n deus ex n is by far the most accessible of its peers where games like n system shock 2 n or n vampire the masquerade bloodlines n had great diversity in buildcrafting and emergent gameplay there was always an almost cruel sense that there was specific comically unspecified character that large chunk of the games were designed for perhaps the absence of this ill balancing alone is what made n deus ex n more popular than its contemporaries but such an assessment perhaps fails to do justice to the feats of design that elevates it so much higher n n deus ex n doesn have even close to the same sense of aesthetics of other role playing games of its era rather unremarkable soundtrack with no astounding moments of art direction to really speak of there is great detail in its real estate but other than that one could not find the common constituents of game atmosphere to draw in through naturalistic ways so why then is n deus ex n so deeply immersive dynamism never before has world felt as reactive as this there is only one true instance where the world is not completely open ended to you where the game of the year version has made progressing to the level 2 labs of versalife impossible to do before returning to tong other than that every area puts the ball in your court if you can dream up solution chances are it can be done npcs objectives access to areas all remains seamless and alters accordingly pick up key before talking to an npc who tells you to go get it its not just that denton will be quick to mention this its the fact that you could potentially just walk past the npc entirely and get the move on there no disconnect in decision making you ll feel connected to denton the way you should playing game like this ,0
don remember it at all like anything about it in the slightest ,1
bioshock 2 definitely doesn do everything better than the first game but actually still enjoy it ever so slightly more the guns are better playing as big daddy and using the drill is awesome you can use weapons and plasmids at the same time and the entire plasmid system is expanded upon pretty massively to the point where you become insanely overpowered basically everything gameplay related especially combat is improved upon significantly it has bit of slow start and some of the changes are little awkward to get used to at first but it only gets better as it progresses better to have that than be like the first game and hit its peak too early ,1
the writing is sometimes really bad but usually just bland the gameplay though is great it fixes lot of the issues had with the first game gameplay wise ,0
kinda mid but ringo hot,1
i wish ringo was in game actually enjoyed playing ,1
sem entrar em spoilers eu genuínamente acho que falam mal demais desse jogo apesar de todas as críticas que eu possa ter ele ,0

t megaten game can say it as bad as people make it o,0
ton of tedious things in this game always just makes me return to other roguelites after spending 50 minutes on another mostly empty run,0
my favorite twin stick shooter as of writing,1
this game is so much fun the concept is awesome the gameplay is awesome the game is challenging but not as unfair as feel rogue like games can be sometimes beware this game is extremely challenging and will require time investment in order to enjoy to the fullest especially if you are unfamiliar with bullet hell games the game is humorous and polished the game is packed with content variety and endless new experiences am not fan of rogue like games generally but this game was the exception to the rule ,1
an arcade journey through the mysterious world of texas ,0
peak fiction more like mid fiction,0
not unproblematic but this game art and sound direction is incredible and its earnest hopeful and so n real n portrayal of trauma means lot to me ,0
this game will preach empathy and love to victims of all kinds of bigotry except racism and then woobify the weird pedophilic relationship abhorrently inconsistent and just miserable to think about worsened by how average and unremarkable so much of the game strengths feel beyond the 2 obvious highlight characters just read umineko instead if you want to see this sort of story done with any tact and more interesting writing to boot one of the most disappointing experiences ve ever had with game ,0
this was such an incredible unique experience to read through the story the aesthetics and soundtrack are all so captivating found myself falling more and more enchanted in each part went through the stories and its characters this vn through its heartbreaking tragic and yet bittersweet story telling has impacted me to the point dont think would forget story like it ,0
i can put into words how much loved this story think writing anything about this game will ruin it charm so please read and witness one of the best love stories of all time ,1
it genuinely impossible to fully convey the experience of going through this vn please give it try if you re willing to deal with its honestly kinda bad pacing issues even so loved this ,0
you ll love this game if you grew up on nes snes games you ll also probably like it if you just like action platformers in general really solid game also it is not metroidvania if thats what anyone is looking for ,1
this game is the poster child for 8 bit throwback games and with good reason it basically captures the nes era of games the best it possibly can while also bringing it up to date with modern design conventions it basically the gold standard for those kinds of games so if you fancy yourself nice 2d platformer and want solidly good 8 bit throwback this is your game theres also ton of free bonus campaigns in this game but still haven played those yet should get around to doing that someday ,1
shovel knight seriously rocks what really shines is the level design soundtrack and main mechanic of bouncing with the shovel the death defying jumps make the game stressful but it doesn make it too challenging would give this one try if you like 2d platformers it seriously is classic ,0
here a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty do you actively avoid playing games from the pre 3d era because of their lack of availability or because their foundation is comparatively primitive and therefore jarringly inaccessible the reason can be because these games are locked in an archival vault for they are commonly ported to modern platforms it must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date mon fess up m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections but there seems to be widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception especially those of the early pixelated 2d period released before the late 1990s sneering distaste for the classics isn as pervasive with films or music zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001 space odyssey high as kite and emphatically detail their transcendental experience to their peers with pulp fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms no one is delusional enough to place the prequels or disney star wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age maybe it because spend too much time on the internet but ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is more common practice among teenagers now than it was when was in high school older video games on the other hand are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts admittedly as someone born in the early 3d era many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating can count merely handful of games that were released before was born that are among my personal favorites as there is only so much pain can handle before my spirit shatters and am in dire need of relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort conversely there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era and the shift to 3d left them bewildered they ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal after certain point where the gaming industry reached point of proficiency with 3d visuals to an almost cinematic extent games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork one of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old school revival games was shovel knight 2d side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers ,0
a walking simulator with an uninteresting story about grief with questionable writing and voice acting fire watch teases supernatural horror elements but doesn actually have any is just game where you move forward and some guy whines about how sad he is ,0
it has such great atmosphere and then just totally flops at the end maybe that what they were going for but it didn do much for me ,1
walking simulator nothing special but really enjoyed it,1
this game is that simple kind of genius that leaves you hungry for more the fact that we have not gotten single game that captures this game feeling since then is eating my stomach from the inside out ,0
structural issues and awkward world design mixed with solid gameplay also dont remember single boss ,0
the game probably has one of the best set of characters in the series lucatiel creighton and pate are genuinely amazing but hafta be real with ya everything else ranges from really great to dear god what is this,1
the conversations around this game have revolved into twisted form of mockery ,0
that literally the worst dark souls but at the same time my favorite one ,1
this is by far the hardest souls game for me fume knight killed me far too many times the story and atmosphere is similar to that of 1 good ,0
nota disso aqui na dlc pq eu sou burro,0
while the gameplay can be bit stiff think the plateforming is really not the best aspect of the game there are few collisions problem still enjoyed playing this game enough to do multiple playthroughs n but more than gameplay what stood out for me is the lore and its inspirations the art direction and the beautiful pixel art also really like discovering every new gore finishing move animation haha n really curious to see the sequel ,1
que lore foda gameplay bonitinho mas namoral quase chorei de raiva por causa dos 2 ultimos boss do jogokkkkkkkkk que desgraça,0
quando criatividade estilo conseguem simplesmente carregar um jogo arte supera qualquer orçamento blasphemous traz uma visão perturbadora dantesca de um mundo apocalíptico visceral governado por um deus misterioso tortuoso em infindável punição dos pecadores que habitam ,0
did you know final fantasy xiv now has freetrial with the new heavensward expa anyways really wish had friends to play this with me ,1
a realm reborn is alright at the best of times and utterly painful at worst but it gets pass due to preceding some incredible stories that wouldn be the same without it ,0
it turns out don enjoy how mmorpgs work triple triad is great though ,1
tldr arr starts slow but gets good played and dropped this game the first time before the story got good which is shame but made the second time around 8 months later an even better experience would recommend anybody to play this game if they re willing to be patient when it comes to the story becoming interesting and if they have somebody to play this game with it not necessary and this game can honestly be played solo but you re missing out on lot if you re not interacting with anybody in an mmo loved it and can wait to start heavensward when have the time to devote myself to it ,1
the lastest game from san barlow the creator of her story and telling lies comes another fmv game where the game part is less and less important it took me hours before felt understood the purpose of anything was doing in this game get m watching clips of story out of order but game like her story at least had it make sense and gave you goal from the start here it aimless watching of three different movies out of order until you get the twist and then it just becomes mindless hunt ,0
this was some crazy stuff ,0
three intriguing and well shot films expose little by little subplot that both sinister and fanatical it at the expense of being little repetitive going through and clicking things beautifully acted and sam barlow and team continue to challenge the notion of what constitutes video game ,0
immortality conta história de marissa marcel marissa estrelou 3 filmes porem nenhum deles chegou sequer n ser lançado navegando por fragmentos perdidos de gravações dos filmes estrelados por marissa marcelo resta n ao jogador descobrir verdade entender que aconteceu com marissa marcel n immortality possui uma gameplay completamente diferente do convencional jogo nos apresenta uma série de n clipes dos antigos filmes estrelados por marissa nosso trabalho é analisar cada um dos clipes para descobrir n verdade por trás do desaparecimento da atriz história é complexa difícil de ser entendida primeiro n momento porem isso te instiga investigar descobrir os segredos escondidos nas gravações n immortality é um jogo narrativamente muito bom porem difícil de ser entendido talvez não seja um jogo n para todos porem com certeza cumpre seu papel em instigar jogador descobrir uma verdade oculta ,0
sam barlow has been inovating in interactive narratives in amazing ways for long time does not get enough credit think since silent hill shattered memories which is masterpiece in storytelling he has been introducing amazing ideas in new ways on how to tell story ,1
ive played 2 hours of this game and the amount of visual errors and pure laziness in series that thrives on environmental design is depressing ,0
i ve never played game that can figure out what it wanted to be the whole story is mess campaigns are split between action horror fighting and puzzles and unnecessary qtes,0
garbage,0
i mean it better in co op with friend so you can laugh through the insufferable repetitive wtf sections story was chill idk man it just eh chris best look tho 3,0
i only really recommend it in co op but it a fun co op experience even with all the jank and poorly designed bits the shooting and combat mechanics are both top notch and really carry the game ,1
crush you graaaaah ,0
after the huge disappointment that 2 was this was ridiculously surprising with the quality was presented the story is good and gameplay mechanics like the combo sytem keep you completely immersed all the time you play it ,0
devil may cry 3 é sem sombras de duvidas uma revolução na franquia dmc jogo veio com uma pegada muito mais única original do que seus antecessores trouxeram dmc3 não tem medo de mudar ele levou franquia para um lado mais cômico estiloso insano n acredito que depois do fracasso que foi dmc2 capcom não podia ter acertado mais com esse game pois tudo que vimos depois na franquia tem algum ponto de inspiração no dmc3 n dante veio com uma pegada muito mais badass nesse game aumentando muito seus números de piadas lutas estilosas isso deixou personagem muito mais único que nos games anteriores isso sem falar de todo elenco de personagens que tem muito mais foco grandeza nesse capítulo da série joguem dmc3 ,0
amazing acting amazing story amazing art direction amazing ambience and world building the minute to minute gameplay is alright ,1
at first was skeptical did the game and dlc need remake the answer is yes the improvements are delight for the eyes the gameplay is well refined and its fits now graphically perfectly with the sequel ,1
still as good as ever,1
 played before 2023 n for the full review just check my review of the n original n it is the same exact game basically with coat of paint big issue though is the fact that there is no multiplayer which think they should ve ported over but get why they didn want to ,0
amazing game,1
rage inducing mechanical behemoth ,0
 played before 2023 n honestly don remember much from this game other than beating it and few other things never got super frustrated but it had fun levels and cute artstyle definitely not my type of gameplay though ,0
precision platforming perfection,1
mid 2000 stoner humor packed into an artificially difficult platformer apparently that what the indie world wanted back in 2010 because super meat boy exploded in popularity ,0
i was kinda disapoiinted with the difficulty as finished the full game on my first session with it but the game was fun and addicting enough to make me want to play the full story in one sitting so that shows how much fun the game really is ,0
an iconic sci fi whole greater than the sum of its parts ,1
best story with amazing characters crushed with garbage ending ,0
the game itself is worth 4 5 leaning on five almost every single player dlc is in the this collection except pinnacle station though that isn a loss if you re ever so inclined you can restore it using mod ,0
i had always heard good things about the mass effect series but never got to experience them until this was released love any type of game that lets me build and act out character as see fit and being able to take said character through three different games and let them flesh out is truly immersive experience enjoyed downright every second of this game yes even me1 and would gladly recommend it to any rpg fan out there ,1
parece um jogo bem besta eu não tenho menor interesse em jogar isso mas arte é bonitinha,1
this was puzzle game and łukasz drew art for it wow ,1
a great game and funny puzzle and the sexy girls make it much more likely n 7 4,1
fun one sitting game,1
it was alright lol my first mainline pokemon game and had so much fun catching and exploring but the quality and graphics weren the best ,1
bland pokemon game why do you all keep buying these games ,0
it good for first time,1
ya cute there are better pokemon games but think this was pretty fun,1
i never played the original crash trilogy on the psx but felt that this remakes were pretty amazing upgrades for people looking to experience the original crash bandicoot gameplay some lovely track remixes as well only struggle really had was warped time trials and bonus stages ,0
never played the original games but hoo boy it looks like missed out on some good shit,0
great revisit to ps1 classic that made part of my childhood ,1
isth fweakin cwash bandicoot,0
it was hard but fully completed them,0
faithful recreations with the right amount of artistic changes and added time trials to all three games makes this solid collection of some of the best precision platformers ,1
fucking love tetris timeless game ,0
a great colorful port of the arcade classic featuring two game modes ,1
hard tetris game to go wrong with albeit not as iconic as the game boy version the type is your classic endless game of tetris and the type involves clearing certain amount of garbage blocks plays by asshole tetris rules where blocks are pure random so you can get completely screwed by rng my major gripe with this game is the controls moving blocks left to right is very slow and it feels like the blocks rotate in way where keep accidentally misplacing them no hard drops either respect the people that play this competitively for learning how to master the controls because sure as hell had hard time getting the ending of the game by clearing level 9 speed 5 height game is total crap shoot due to the rng of what blocks you get and the arrangement of the garbage blocks so just stick to the game not my favorite version of tetris but still does the job ,0
bem simples mas exige bastante estratégia sorte mesmo não curtindo muito seu gênero consigo me divertir um pouquinho vale pena jogar pelo valor histórico ,0
corporate garbage,0
i hate life,0
consegue ser pior que lol,0
just not my sort of game dont hate it though,0
i wish they would stop making fps games where moving your character while shooting gives them parkinson ,1
é meu game de plantaforma preferido ja zerei diversas vezes nunca deixa de ser divertido pode ser jogado com até 4 pessoas ,1
best mario game have ever played this game is pure joy ,1
3d land ma meglio tornare usare più personaggi è una boccata aria fresca il multiplayer è divertentissimo per quanto non sia studiato per questo il gioco level design stellare soddisfacente da completare un po un peso completare tutti livelli con tutti personnaggi ,0
great gameplay and the pacing of the gunplay is far more restrained than the last row things which is really good however the story while entertaining as always thanks to excellent acting and character interaction is filled with plot holes and side plots that go nowhere which is why deducted the extra half start from the score besides that it an on par if not slightly improved gameplay experience from n among thieves n ,1
awarded bonus half star for introducing charlie cutter,1
why all don like this one it great,1
remember when greg miller gave this 10 10 and everyone lost their minds that was laugh ,0
god these games are so frustrating some times but damn they re good,0
ace attorney at its best this one is more ace attorney but it puts so many spins on the formula that everything feels new ,1
i liked this game but found godot to be pretty annoying tbh,1
kino based raw peak fiction etc etc ,0
the only game from the original trilogy that the fandom has the right opinion about,1
fey supremacy,1
such an unique experience love it,1
yume nikki love you,1
yume nikki is one of those games often point to in conversation with fellow designers as shining example of how well video game can capture specific person experience these types of rpg maker horror games usually get bad rap they are often cheap products made by inexperienced designers who believe that mashing teenage girl protagonists with horrific set pieces will instantly make work profound yume nikki does not deserve to be lumped in with the contemporaries kikiyama the developer managed to extract clever narrative meaning within the bounds of rpg maker limited toolset in way that left me genuinely floored this game is best approached completely blind so will refrain from saying any details but it has transformed the way approach experiential design even if the games want to make look nothing like this ,0
looking at weird shit is fun and this has plenty more weird things going on than my boring ass dreams,0
um tps com um level design excelente história boa gameplay muito satisfatória pérola do ps2 ,1
alright here we go my name is chatgpt and ve seen my fair share of dark days but today m here to talk about game that hits close to home max payne ,0
max payne still rules at times it can be little difficult and repetitive but the bullet time campy plot and cinematic flair make it must play ,0
max payne is such good game with some crippling problems that really date it the voice acting is top tier and james mccaffrey is the biggest reason for this success and is one of the best voice actors ever the gameplay is unqiue and so satisfying diving through the air as the world explodes around you and bullets whiz past you the depiction of new york as this grim snowy crime ridden land fits so well with the place and the cheesiness makes this so good but played this on the pc port and the game crippling issues with the difficulty slider got annoying really quick walking through door and getting insta headshot three times and then the fourth time doing the same thing and not having it happen got annoying and supposedly there is major bug that makes it so the difficulty slider which is tied to the only difficulty you can play at the start is broken and doesn properly balance the game as well some aspects feel little too gamey in this serious tale with few levels sticking out like sore thumb the underground level feel enemy variety wasn really thing just the same enemy that got stronger and stronger but overall this is very good game with aspects that haven ever really been replicated as well which is shame we need more top tier slow mo shooters ,0
nunca consegui passar da primeira noite aaaaaaaaaa,0
a gameplay é solida divertida ,1
this game ruined my life,0
this is the scariest game ve ever played the jumpscares had me jumping in fear the freddy fazbear is so scary,0
near perfect sequel to dkc music is fantastic the level themes of pirate ships and spooky forests are fun and the secret world is lots of fun ,1
this sequel holds up but with the novelty gone it took solid level design to keep people interested and that game delivers ,1
all time great if you could only play one donkey kong country game of the trilogy this is the one the graphics are yet more refined from the previous entry and still hold up in shocking feat for early 3d cg the levels are even more fun now with less of the unfun types of levels from the previous game barrel levels and the minecart levels are actually very fun here in addition the secrets in this game are more fun to go after with more substantial rewards plus the new level elements and animal buddies are cool to toy with n this is all without the major haymaker this game hits you with the n music n man this is legit among the best video game soundtracks of all time it timeless and composer david wise work here is at it master craft status the soundtrack graphics and level design all work in symphony to craft this masterpiece of platformer ,1
i won mince my words here the last month has been bit underwhelming don get me wrong there have been some solid titles that finally got to finish and everything been interesting enough to where still wrote about it but nothing quite blown my mind recently flywrench might have set the bar bit too high for better or for worse so it looks like it time for another nostalgia reset what better way to get myself back in gear than to go back to the source consider this write up follow up to my original n donkey kong country n piece since think ve fleshed out obstacle escalation theory ton by this point ll focus more on differences between the two games this time around ,0
this is as close to perfection you can get for 2d platformer it oozes atmosphere while having varied themes and locations and the game rewards those who goes the extra mile to nab all the secrets with extra levels casually or completionist doesn matter there a great and challenging game in store for you ,1
recomendado el pack completo ,1
the ultimate 2d platform game with epic musics n each time you play it you beat every level faster some says sonic games are only based on speed do not agree speed is the true reward from mastering this game ,1
this one was pretty good actually maybe like two courses didnt like but damn enjoyable,1
this will always be the best classic sonic game ,1
a product of the time but the tank controls work perfectly with the fixed camera angles and the game is designed well around this fact the design translates to tension in gameplay and item management is so fun and challenging always fun to speedrun ,1
 played before 2023 n man this is such good game with so much replayability it is short and sweet but you can experience this in new ways multiple times not only with the different characters but also the scenarios it really focused on making the first game but better and you can tell the huge budge increase and the restart in development helped it get to this point think from all the classic re games this one is my favorite with 1make being close second ,1
a definitive improvement over the original controls are tighter inventory is better weapons are cooler enemies are more varied and the story and presentation have taken step up the map is also less cumbersome to backtrack through compared to the re1 mansion but will admit it loses bit of the atmosphere still good game ,0
by far the best version of the 2nd game unlike the remake the original does not lack in consistency character interactions ambience and soundtrack the remake simply ruins everything about the story and characters to just appeal those who only care about gameplay and graphics ,0
i loveeeeeeeee muramasa my spider wife,1
dark elf footjob,0
never thought d play vn where the true end is the worst one but this is it genuinely different vn that reads like the author unfiltered ideas and some land and others don when it hits it n really n hits but when it doesn it kinda falls flat no regrets spending my time with it but can recommend it to everyone hero route is pure kino ,0

a sinopse que fala que é dos mesmos criadores de amnesia passa mensagem errada sobre jogo por mais que ainda seja um jogo de horror ele não tem mais nenhum elemento de survival seu foco é em sua história jogo não tem jumpscares ou coisa do tipo é extremamente atmosférico é nela na historia que você desvenda ao longo do jogo que está verdadeiro horror do jogo em questão de gameplay jogo é dividido entre seções onde você resolve puzzles que geralmente não são tão complicados também algumas seções em que você tem encontro com inimigos deve tentar utilizar as mecânicas do jogo para avançar jogo não tem combate ou você se esconde ou você corre se você gosta de um jogo com uma história bem feita ou com uma atmosfera bem imersiva recomendo em questão de jogo de sustinho pode ser que não seja jogo ideal pra você ,0
makes you think what defines oneself ,1
boring gameplay interesting ideas,0
this is the only walking sim that had actually impacted me in any shape or form where games like edith finch squander for me soma excels in every possible regard the story that tied to philosophical questions that have been explored many times before was still immensely engaging and leaves you with an amazing ending that with any form of attention paid could ve been seen coming but still hits as hard as it could ,1
acredito que esse talvez seja melhor roguelike já lançado mesmo tendo sido um dos primeiros nesse estilo até hoje é um dos melhores que eu já joguei n único erro é só poder colocar mods com dlc não lembro qual era n caso você queira um jogo pra você conseguir jogar pra sempre definitivamente esse jogo é uma ótima escolha ainda mais se você for tentar fazer tudo que tem ,0
the gold standard roguelite 1 point deduction for just how incredibly tedious lot of the unlocks are but still did most of it 3 times anyway,1
this used to be my favorite game of all time now think it is pretty good,1
don be greedy for greedy person is idolater worshipping the things of this world because of these sins let the curse of the maze be upon thee ,0
really fun game love rougelikes,1
perfect roguelike keeps you motivated to try again and again with its fair difficulty and rewarding exploration it was blast to keep getting better and better at every run by understanding the enemies movement and patterns thought the items could be more explained but supposed it part of the experience for you to also learn how they work and what they do,1
really good and really short better than dark moon ,1
the game is really atmospheric for nintendo horror game mechanically the game is just satisfying to play appreicate the rumble when you use the vacuum and things like that the game felt like it was missing something and ,1

the perfect video game arguably the most video game of all time the prime example of how large story is not always needed when the gameplay and soundtrack are with the stars ,1
literally best game ever love mario kart n played this all the time on my 3ds ,1
it had fucking bee,0
i racked up 80 hours in this one despite it having no bikes really shitty roster and bland tracks was also middle schooler ,0
mario kart 7 is game that have such fond memories of playing the courses with friends at camp using download play really was an experience you couldn get anywhere else looking past my nostalgia the tracks are gorgeous wuhu loop maka wuhu daisy cruiser and neo bowser city are some of my personal favorites there isn really reason to go back and play it now due to the existance of mario kart 8 deluxe but still love this game,1
eu te amo castle crashers,0
click heavy game my fingers hurt from playing got entertainment from it as kid but can enjoy it due to fairly repetitive combat and unsatisfying controls ,1
fun gaem friend,1
fun beat em up co op game definitely need friends to really enjoy though ,1
i will choose the blue one guys amazing game but when you play alone it boring n 8 7,0
muito bom quase perfeito mas dificuldade sozinha te faz querer não recomendar para ninguém,1
my favorite part about this buddhist suffering simulator where you play as helpless prey animal eliminating the indigenous populace by way of guerilla warfare with high explosives of course ,0
a cat that needs to survive hostile world that visually reminded me of something like out of this world or other cinematic platformers from the 90s but very different one fundamentally to them it a world that was once obsessed with trascendence and technological advancement to the point the population destroyed itself with robot that after everything was no more still fed his ego with new creations to the point he lost his mind even if he never means to have caused harm ,0
i don know why but it is so frustrating to die in this game yes know skill issue ,0
good,1
an extremely fun party game which combines mini games and other elements from parties past if only it had more boards ,1
bem poucos mapas comparado com outros jogos da série poucas opções de customização porém presença de vários minigames de múltiplos consoles acaba tornando as partidas bem variadas divertidas ,0
embrace the hatred your scorn your spite the negative emotions you know you enjoy it ,0
lo mejor que saco rockstar para ps2 el sa le gana igual en gigantesa post game pero en mecanicas no n me gusta que podes besar hombres porque es mas inmersivo yo lo hacia en secundaria ,1
we will never get sequel or follow up to this game that makes me very sad ,0
esse jogo tem um swag consideravelmente maior do que todos os gtas já lançados,0
de lo mejor de rockstar,1
um dos maiores sucessos da rockstar aqui jogo é bem divertido ambiente escolar de cidade pequena é muito bem construído a vibe dos anos 50 nos tempos modernos se encaixa muito bem no jogo um dos jogos escolares de mundo aberto mais exclusivos do mercado um deve jogar definitivamente ,1
lil moustache man what you doing in that go kart ,0
took what started with super mario kart and ran with it really solid racing game ,1
this mario kart favors comedy over balance drifting has learning curve and can be overused like in the other mario kart games and the ai and item balance can be ruthless some courses are designed rather maliciously and in the multiplayer mode random bombs litter the tracks for no reason you think all of that would combine to make very frustrating and not fun mario kart game but honestly the opposite is true it honestly fun to just get absolutely destroyed because the game didn like you that round in cathartic sense there no music that plays when more than 2 people are in splitscreen though which makes the game kinda feel empty ngl just play some of your own music over it instead guess think in chaotic party game terms this is the best kart racer ,0
the first octopath game was 10 10 for me but man they went and improve on everything with this game enjoyed every second of it so much definitely my goty for 2023 so far and think it will be really hard for others games to steal the spot,1
there isn much to say here that hasn been said but regardless octopath traveler ii is one of my new favorite turn based jrpgs ,1
octopath traveler ii is one of the greatest jrpgs of all time ,1
i remember barely anything about the first octopath traveler so some things praise or complain about here might just be holdovers ,1
yeah this game is great it improves on the original in almost every conceivable way the writing is better the gameplay has more qol features and is faster and smoother the world is more interesting to explore there a better overarching story that surprisingly emotional by the end amongst other things ,1
fuck prose all my homies hate flowery boring prose ,0
wow that was very effectively crafted nightmare,1
i liked lot of what this game was there were some fun and zany secrets that found and probably some that didn it a point and click game so that was the primary gameplay there were some random feeling minigames but they were fine the narrative is where it at with this game and thought it was good loved the setting being in louisiana the art was very creepy and moody ,1
a southern gothic science fiction adventure game taking place as the protagonist kay returns to her hometown in post civil war us amid worldwide catastrophes in order to find her brother after your mothers death from cancer new orleans is an industrial dystopia overseen by the shield chemical corporation stand in for shell oil that is in the real life area and as you explore more you learn about mysterious client your mother was working for and the different people that had taken an interest in her the lead occasionally shifts to the recent past where you play as kay mother norco has little focus on traditional adventure puzzle solving where you mostly find and combine items and instead will often give you multiple ways to handle problem minor turn based qte and memory based combat text adventure scenes driving boat in swamp set in an alligator hand puppet poetry while disco elysium and kentucky route zero dabbled in some similar themes and dealt with stranger and magical elements of an otherwise often serious and more realistic setting norco goes further into the strange and leaves with much less concretely answered ,0
dói me muito falar mal desse jogo até porque gostei dele no geral é um jogo tão diferente do que estamos acostumados um realismo fantástico bem pessoal com arte impecável n talvez meu maior problema com norco seja exatamente este ele é pessoal demais lendo declarações do criador vi que ele mora na cidade que inspirou norco vivia perto de uma usina de extração de óleo da shell local onde chegou ter explosão ele falava de como cresceu vendo aquele dragão de fogo saindo da chaminé sinto que ele não conseguiu passar isso tão bem com jogo é algo pessoal demais tem seu valor por isso mas ainda assim comunicação não foi tão eficaz n ademais ter escutado antes de jogar que se tratava de um jogo de esquerda termo meio bobo fez eu ver quão batida era essa tecla eu até ria de como em todo lugar tinha alguém falando mal de uma empresa de aplicativo sendo explorado por esquemas sofrendo com poluição empresarial sei que isso acontece na vida real mas como é um jogo point click colocar npcs para falarem essas coisas deixa narrativa viciada repetitiva ,0
pretty fantastic art direction and world building and genuinely funny dialogue for video game the basic ending is extremely unsatisfying wish it didn ,0

so much more but not in the mystery that sparks your ima,0
ay or the cool setup to possible sequel ,1
dated gameplay but still great atmosphere ,1
love everything about this besides actually playing it unfortunately,1
the absolute peak of survival horror as far as gameplay is concerned every single ressource counts whether you kill enemies or not matters what route you take matters all the while giving you plenty of freedom to do things in the order that you want while also having an insane amount of replay value ,0
unequivocally one of the best games of all time don really know what else to say that hasn already been said it a bonafide masterpiece ,1
a solid game that has length issues ,0
assassin creed odyssey game that taken me two years to complete believe started playing this right after origins which finished in 2020 at some point game that ve actually beaten n twice n because once finished my first playthrough completionist run also known as n mistake n realized that remembered nothing of the story so replayed the game n again n this time as kassandra two birds with one stone right and played through the story just so could see if the story was actually bad game that have unfortunately spent over 200 hours in and will be spending more time in as still have the expansions to complete and the rest of the achievements for those to complete what do think of it after all this time after about two and half years of playing after playing the game twice because the story was just that uneventful for me ,0
i wonder why waited so long to play this game greece during the peloponnesian war was dream setting for an assassin creed game that had been asking for back when was big fan of the series probably don have to think too hard as to why it took me so long since had heard lot of negative things about the game which now realise was from lot of ac fans feeling spurned by the new direction despite enjoying origins wasn chomping at the bit to play an iterative sequel so yes that why waited so long but m glad ve played it now since adore it origins was mostly an action adventure game with some rpg mechanics which incidentally describes most games these days ultimately the rpg side of the game wasn particularly substantial while it watered down the fun stealth action and parkour from earlier entries in the series n assassin creed odyssey is absolutely an rpg though it very wholeheartedly embraces the genre ,0

loved this game so much that played it twice to get my first ever playstation platinum trophy this is the game that made me supergiant fan and is my second favorite game in their catalog behind hades loved everything about this game from the music and art style that create the vibe to the gameplay and story that deliver on it n n disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 8 years ago ,1
one of my favourite games of all time everything is so well crafted between the strange almost cyberpunk semi dystopia utopia of cloudbank the wonderful interactions between red and the transistor and the most incredible video game soundtrack have ever heard bar none there are so many small details that serve to elevate this story and world to another level that can only be appreciated on repeat playthroughs and the ending is just perfect like the combat lot but it isn the highlight and everything else overshadows it though it is still designed well and used in interesting ways especially when you bump up the difficulty ,1
classic supergiant goodness ,1
tries to capture the same magic that re4 has but doesn have as interesting combat or characters ,1
awesome gameplay traversing and fighting your way through the nightmarish setpieces is super cool and enjoyable every weapon you get has its purpose and found myself using all of them which can appreciate lot as it adds variety my big criticism is that the story is just okay the characters are uninteresting and the dialogue writing is quite frankly bad the characters reactions are so tame compared to the dire situations they re in and rarely do they emote with any intensity their lives are constantly in danger but they sure don act like it the gameplay and environments are genuinely great enough to warrant 4 stars ,0
action games generally operate on the concept of player empowerment granting the tools to overcome any challenge without scratch as long as players have the skill to realize that potential meanwhile horror games operate on the concept of player n disempowerment n giving the bare minimum in order to foster tense atmosphere so balancing the priorities of each genre seems like mixing oil and water resident evil games are famous for trying to do so but they usually break into horror centric first half and an action centric back half without true blending of the concepts the evil within meanwhile actually managed it but had to alienate players in some key ways in order to do so firstly the logic behind the story is nearly impossible to follow at first leaving players unable to find their footing confused at why the progression is so jumpy and unfocused then the mechanical restrictions feel like they re equally arbitrary sebastian can only initially carry about twelve bullets and not even full healthbar worth of recovery he can barely run at all and in order to alleviate any of this you may have to bank up green gel over the course of multiple chapters it can seem like the game is simply trying to make action feel scary by stressing out players with cheap deaths but once you commit to learning the game brilliant method behind the madness reveals itself while the story n is n mostly nonsense the abstract nature of it allows for level design suited to wide variety of challenges with new mechanics being introduced at steady pace players are constantly kept on the backfoot and thus disempowered even as their growing mechanical knowledge empowers them the shallow capacity for supplies is an obvious form of disempowerment which prompts players to spend resources cleverly but their abundance between each fight empowers players to use their entire toolkit freely the upgrade system empowers the below par baselines make unupgraded stats more of problem in the face of scaling challenge for every give there a take and thus harmony between action and horror is reached as stated before though the take for that brilliance is frontloaded sense of disempowerment with players having to get through most of the game before they ve experienced enough character growth and skill development to redress the balance so really can blame anyone for bouncing off of this game but also truly believe that as of today less than week away from re4 remake it the best merging of action and horror in gaming resident evil 4 is pure satisfying action dead space commits to bloody horror but the evil within is purely both ,0
actually really fun but rpcs3 is being little bitch rn,0
can never get into this game garbage scripted events at every turn no thanks,0
should have won best ost 2022,1
may revisit it eventually on pc but there is not enough here to compel me to finish the game aside from the soundtrack which is very very good got about half way through and if was more into rhythm games or better at shooters on controller would probably just bite the bullet and spend few hours more in it but think d get more enjoyment from just listening to the soundtrack ,1
oyun kullanıcısının elinden asla tutmuyor sıkılıyorsunuz ve aynı boss durmadan cok basit mekanikler ekleyerek önümüze sunmuşlar şahsen bunu oynayacağıma doom oynarım oyunun sonuna kadar bile katlanamadım ,0
imagine que aconteceria se você misturasse temática visual sanguinolência de doom com as clássicas mecânicas de jogos rítmicos baseadas em apertar botões no tempo certo bom essa mistura existe se chama metal hellsinger se você já jogou doom alguma vez na sua vida provavelmente já reparou que um dos pontos fortes da saga são suas trilhas sonoras marcantes que conseguem tornar experiência de cortar demônios ainda mais prazerosa n pensando nisso desenvolvedora the outsiders resolveu criar sua própria versão do clássico de 1993 porém com adição de uma mecânica um pouco diferente ritmo gameplay de metal hellsinger se baseia em realizar as ações tradicionais de um jogo de tiro atirar pular esquivar recarregar porém tudo sincronizado com música n no centro da tela ao lado da mira do jogador existe um marcador com bpm da música objetivo é realizar as ações do jogo dentro do tempo quanto mais preciso você atira mais dano pontos você faz uma das partes que eu mais achei interessante no jogo é seu objetivo aqui seu objetivo não é só completar fase mas também fazer maior pontuação possível n ao todo jogo possui 10 capítulos cada capítulo termina com uma boss fight ao completá lo outros 3 desafios são liberados no mesmo cenário em questão de tempo de gameplay jogo é relativamente curto podendo ser fechado em cerca de 5 horas porém esse tempo pode se estender caso você esteja em busca do 100 n história do jogo é simples porém suficiente para um bom plano de fundo de um tiroteio infernal você joga como desconhecida metade humana metade demônio desconhecida parte através do inferno para recuperar sua voz que foi roubada pela juíza vermelha em sua jornada você deve destruir hordas de demônios seus líderes para enfim travar um combate com juíza recuperar voz que lhe foi roubada n mas vamos falar do que interessa trilha sonora música é ponto alto do jogo como é de se esperar ela é impecavel jogo conta com 15 músicas autorais escritas compostas exclusivamente para título melhor parte é que cada música conta com participação especial de grandes nomes do metal internacional entre os artistas convidados estão alissa white gluz arch enemy mikael stanne dark tranquility tatiana shmayluk jinjer serj tankian system of down além de outros grandes nomes totalizando 9 artistas convidados n as músicas são muito boas qualquer um terá uma experiência agradável jogando porém é claro elas se tornam muito mais prazerosas para aqueles que não só já gostam do gênero mas também para aqueles que já escutavam os artistas convidados previamente n os pontos altos do jogo obviamente são focados na música no gameplay trilha sonora acompanha perfeitamente tiroteio frenético da jornada através do inferno a experiência se torna mais prazerosa com sistema de ritmo fazendo com que você tenha que acertar tiros esquivas recargas no tempo da música também é bom citar como ponto positivo fato dele estar disponível gratuitamente no xbox game pass n não tem muitos pontos negativos no jogo mas se for pra citar algum talvez seja interessante citar tempo de gameplay que em uma zerada apenas pode ser muito curto não compensar os 99 reais investidos claro esse tempo pode aumentar caso você jogue em uma dificuldade mais elevada ou caso você deseje fazer 100 do jogo ,0

unova has the best pokémon designs honestly best gen tbh,1
for generation that is supposedly reinvention of the series this game sure is full of the same shit as all the rest 5th gen includes the very worst of pokemon design at times making exciting fire breathing monsters into demented mundanity ,0
nostalgia bias 2nd best pokemon game the best one is the sequal,1
possibly the ugliest generation in pokemon history which is very low bar considering gens 8 9 and 4 gen 5 also has easily the worst ou meta in the franchise history but at least uu is fun and lot of the new monster designs are cool ,0
n gotta be enough to play this game best pokemon game and probably will continue to be so ,1
 played before 2023 n this is probably the best non combat horror game ve played but really hate non combat horror games because it takes away lot of choices you can make which makes it scarier to me it isn that scary gameplay wise when my only option is to run down hallway and hide in locker or bed the asylum is cliche but fun setting but m not that impressed with the game like lot of other peple are think it just came out at good time where most of thse type of games and still now were cheap lazy works or were created by one single person ,1
nice atmosphere the rest is okay as you probably know the game is mostly walking through corridors did still enjoy the main campaign but things got old fast in the dlc ,1

another walking simulator with stupidly easy puzzles and platforming no fail states or challenge of any kind but the art style does make it at least interesting to look at for while ,0
i loved sable from its gorgeous visuals to its beautiful music and meaning ve lost track of time exploring the world and its different biomes talking to strange characters climbing huge areas etc performance may be little bit wacky at times on pc but overall it was great experience cannot but recommend it to anyone looking for wholesome open world adventure that doesn length too much ,1
initially awesome open world exploration game that suffers from overambition but still provides worthwhile journey n intriguing fantasy desert setting with lot of alien structures and cultures to discover n simple and short story that delivers its theme of finding purpose in freedom excellently n unique art style with little to no shading and shifting colors to make for constantly changing impressions n light environmental puzzles and decent collectibles strewn about just right to fill the map n well thought out movement mechanics in climbing gliding and driving that are built to fit the world and not the other way around as is often the case n overly restrained soundtrack with couple amazing songs being hidden in favor of unremarkable ambiance n clunky physics most noticeable on the essential bike n terrible performance as well as frequent glitches of all kinds,0
a cute little mess way too ambitious for its own good ,1
i like how the for also works as 4 ,1
the one that was fun for its time but not worth playing anymore ,1
this feels soooo slow to return to,0
alas this game was my breaking point for this series like brawl got really swept up in the hype cycle and was so excited to play this when it was announced followed every character announcement and direct all the way to launch where proceeded to play the everloving shit out of it also wanted to be more competitive so started like really grinding this game both online and offline and really all was doing was just burning myself out at an insane rate this game series slowly stopped becoming the special highlight of get togethers and started becoming exhausting can look back at this game in positive light like can for all the previous smash games before it because of that plus smash games before this were unique enough from one another that there enough reason to keep all the previous games around whereas for this game now that ultimates out who the hell is still trying to play this the game is solid but like m still burnt out on this series and have this game and myself to blame ,0
this was one of the first smash bros games ever played and its pretty good to say the least really like how there is lot of content lot of characters and overall just lot of everything for everyone to enjoy really like the concept of having it be cross platform with the 3ds version ,1
very fun game this is where it feels the kirby series truly began as if n kirby dream land n simply acted as prototype for this one the spritework is very charming on the nes the songs are so catchy that they re often remixed into modern games without feeling out of place and the copy ability is fun to tool with even with only one move for each ability also love hi jump ,1
cute little game liked this one lot ,1
poyo fun game,1
massive improvement from kirby dream land the bosses were much more fun and harder the moon and sun the big cloud king dedede and the final boss who made me feel as if was playing gradius for the arcade ahh good nostalgia right there man love it it was genuinely fun ,1
incredibly impressive for an nes title but doesn run the greatest still great game and introduces the copy ability series staple ,1

to many this is the best game out of the entire kingodm hearts series and to be fair there a lot going for this game as with many square enix games they always deliver when it comes to music overall aesthetics especially when compared to kh1 other final fantasy titles the gameplay is greatly improved upon over kingdom hearts 1 in almost every regard camera movement combat platforming everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed with that being said this is where the story begins to take nosedive in every direction personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the roxas portion of the game without skipping cutscenes it going to take long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable ,1
in my review of kh1 remarked on how if played these games as kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites mostly due to how the game had sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was disney title this game felt like it had better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime ass vibes that square enix was known for combined those two elements make for game that feel if had played as kid it would have changed things the same way sonic adventure 2 did for me that right there is powerful energy that can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone unfortunately played this little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally but absolutely recognize that power when see it the game pretty much improves upon the first in every way with better locales fancier and flashier gameplay more intricate plot the whole nine yards my only major gripe that have with it is think the second half could have been streamlined bit better and they could have made both acts for each world happen in row rather than having you go through every world twice outside of that this is particularly special game which is certainly something never thought d say about mfin game where bunch of edgy cloaked dudes and mickey mouse share the same screen space ,1

ust walking through hallways which felt like padding it seems like while the game concept was really cool there really wasn a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game the next portal like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off that being said portal is really high bar so not reaching that expectation does not bad game make since this game is still definitely worth playing imo the story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics which was cool all in all it didn disappoint and would recommend giving it play up there with the portal series as one of the best puzzle games for me m not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one thing like portals or in this case perspective means that it not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do each puzzle is really cool obviously the use of perspective to fiddle with ob,1

having played the standard edition on steam this version has great qol additions but runs worse than the standard edition in my experience other than that see no reason to not get the director cut ,0

i played persona 4 after p5 and my love for this game has stood up to this day the small town of inaba has something mysterious going on and in the midst of it you have to come to find your true selves ,0
as corny as it sounds if had the option to play this game for the first time id take the opportunity,1
is kinda good at times ig,1
the persona series along with its parent series shin megami tensai have generally been consistent with their themes throughout the years the collective unconscious the masks that people wear to conceal their true selves and references to ancient greek and japanese mythology are all motifs that are usually present in smt and persona games this has led to consistently murky tone throughout the series in the undertones when not overtly while the darkest game in the series is up for debate there no debating which is the brightest persona 4 released just 2 years after the decidedly grim persona 3 and on the same engine p4 delivers an overall joyful and optimistic tone that helped it stand out not only from its predecessor but from previous persona and smt games as well this may seem counter intuitive as the focus of the story is on finding murder suspect who kills 2 people within hours of the game beginning yet it the moment to moment dialogue the soundtrack even the color palette the yellow theme provides an overall sunny disposition that makes persona 4 not only joyful experience but joy to experience ,0

far cry 4 is an open world first person shooter that found to be mixed bag on one hand the game offers stunning and immersive world with vast open world map that fun to explore the gameplay mechanics are solid and allow for wide variety of playstyles from stealthy takedowns to full on assaults the game weapon customization system is also impressive allowing for lot of creativity in how you approach each encounter ,1

i think that lot of the people saying that this is one of the worst sonic games of all time are kinda overexaggerating things don think this game is as damaging as something like sonic 06 or sonic boom that being said this game is very bare and there are dozens of other sonic games you could and should play instead of this one the only thing that this game does wrong is just not have any substantial level design or challenge so you just breeze through it in like 3 hours without remembering much of it at all the writing is absolutely corny so if you like that kind of thing then ur gonna be entertained otherwise this game is just like an empty calorie ,1
banger soundtrack but that it ,0
cara nada nesse jogo funciona gameplay do sonic moderno é legal até eu sinto um pouco de falta de paixão do level design mas são poucas fases agora sobre avatar as fases dele são travadas lentas tediosas repetitivas sério não sinto prazer em jogar com meu próprio personagem nem irei comentar sobre clássico porque seria chover no molhado ,0
this game is so fun n don know if it just because of my own sensibilities or low expectations after years of the internet dogpiling on this game but outside of some control issues this was genuinely good time ,0
if you re fan of boost gameplay this sure is video game ,1
a simple game with simple pixel graphics it a point and click adventure with few puzzles but they are very easy to beat and felt like they didn really add much the story has lot of heart and is the main appeal of the game at first wasn a fan of the two scientists but as the game progressed grew to like them lot and now m looking forward to seeing their story continue in other games ,1

the combat takes some getting used to but the story oh do love the story,1
i ve put like sixty hours in this so far and still have ways to go feel like need breaks from this game sometimes but it still top notch ,1
while the combat is lacking the world and the story will keep me enthralled forever,1
took long time because you know work and life stuff n but man what fucking ride revisiting this game and actually doing everything on the world with the new updates it improved an already above average game felt immersed the whole way through side characters and questlines are the golden eggs of this game in one quest there is literally golden egg lol n still have some problems with the main villain think the msq is the least appealing part of the game despite loving ciri as character n words cannot describe the feeling felt after completing everything in blood and wine and being done with this game definitely one of those games you always have fond memories of and probably will keep returning for it from time to time ,1
lil moustache man what you punching your friends for ,0
solid foundation for the juggernaut that is smash bros today gameplay is fine but lacks content compared to future entires ,0
muito divertido possui mais limpo de entender acompanhar em uma boa parte dos mapas na gameplay porém como se trata do começo da franquia balanceamento a otimização das mecânicas não é muito bom ponto que incomda muito os controles do n64 são horríveis o jogo aidna não faz bom uso do analógico deles ,0
still holds up great even if the controls leave little to be desired plenty of single player content too with board the platforms break the targets and classic mode ,0
smash 64 doesn really have lot of content in it ngl but it still dang fun all things considered and also helped start the wacky nonsense that is the modern smash brothers ip if you bust this out at party there going to be good time though if you are more used to the later smash games you ll probably get bored pretty soon ,0
this website is ridiculous but it ok forgive you,0
would have been the best version of mario 64 if it weren for the controls being utter dog shit ,0
borrowed from my friend couple times never completed but loved it don own myself but consider my time with it notable enough to add here ,1
the controls were so bad that they nearly made me cry at multiple intervals,0
it controls really awkwardly due to only using the dpad on the first ever game made to show off the analogue stick but the 30 additional stars and extra characters make it fine mario 64 dlc ,0
its mario 64 but on nintendo ds which is cool because yeehaw portability bonus content and bonus characters but not as cool because no analog control and weird character switching hat switching shenanigans are at play if you don have nintendo 64 this is fine way to experience mario 64 but if you have the means to play the original id rec that one over this one thru charm and playability alone ,0
a good attempt at making mario 64 for the ds more characters and more options are nice but it comes at the cost of controlling the game with the ds controlls which are not great at all if this game came out little later in the ds life span it could of been great or even better yet the 3ds ,1
the chief and cortana stuff is good the rest of the plot is eh and the forerunner enemies can remember all suck still pretty fun to shoot covenant tho,1
played through the whole campaign for the 100th time and its so short with repetitive scenarios and weak new alien race the cortanna plot is still the strongest and most memorable scene ,0
can remember you darling ,1
i was surprised by how much enjoyed halo 4 given the reviews wasn expecting much from it but still had good time it the most modern feeling game mechanic wise in the master chief collection and the story has fitting conclusion to chief and cortana story arc ,1
rating 8 2 10 great,1
halo 4 as game was game whose badness was dramatically oversold to me by people which doesn mean this game is good its probably the worst halo painfully mediocre shooter with terrible story but don find it completely out of line with the rest of the series which is damming of my opinion of halo as whole halo 4 isn the worst modern shooter but unless you have burning desire to play through the entire franchise like have had its not even remotely close to worth your time ,0
it has combat from arkham and assassins creed climbing from uncharted stealth from every 7th gen third person game you spend half of the time clearing out bandit camps and you play the most ai generated character in all of gaming m sure we all remember that iconic lord of the rings characters name this is game so derivative of every other game around it that it lacks any identity and purpose to exist ,0
monolith is an underrated company fear was an underrated franchise in general although the 3rd kind of fell flat luckily they managed to claim some of the respect they were due with this game ,0
a jogabilidade é muito boa jogo tem um sistema de combate bem dinâmico com muitos movimentos habilidades que você pode aprender ao longo do jogo além disso jogo tem sistema nêmesis onde os inimigos que você enfrenta vão se lembrar de você evoluir de acordo com suas ações para mim é ponto alto do jogo ,0
honestly not even that good of game but had blast with the nemesis system and enjoyed doing mindless treasure hunting repetitive missions just because liked making uruks feel as much pain as possible would recommend to family and friends ,1
it assassin creed in middle earth what not to love n the nemesis system is still to this day one of the coolest things ve ever seen in video game and it a shame that wb has done nothing with it since n n disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 8 years ago ,0
manswine,1
mega man 2 basically took everything good about the first game polished it and improved it in every way imaginable with more refined controls less slippery platforming much better stage design iconic boss fights that provide decent challenge more variety in the obtainable powers and improved difficulty balancing alongside another incredible banger of soundtrack can totally see why this game gets the well deserved praise that it gets legitimately fun game that could totally see myself playing more in the future whereas never want to touch the first mega man ever again ,1
without single doubt superior to the first game this is the true seminal episode includes everything that other mega man games will do level design is great challenge is present boss fights are hard enough ,0
this is really where mega man started it has everything going for it too firstly pleasing and charming graphics in spite of nes limitations secondly the soundtrack is phenomenal not just back then but now best nes soundtrack easily and it isn close the levels are very engaging hitting sweet spot of tough but fair the metal blade invalidates lot of enemies but man it fun to use in my review of n super mario bros 3 n mentioned that it was contender for one of the best nes games and holds up in modern times n mega man 2 n was the most poignant example in my mind that stopped me from definitively saying the best ,1
way better level design and difficulty than 1 the robot masters are iconic it has some super banging music and the weapons are overall an improvement in usability and variety truly classic and one of the downright coolest mega man games,1
mega man 2 is an nes game where nowadays you can actually finish the game on first playthrough without using save states or banging your head on wall due to how difficult it is megaman 2 is very balanced game with very good platforming and levels it fixes the issues of mega man 1 which aren many aside from not being janky and difficult as the 1st game this is officially one of my favorite nes games and heavily recommend playing it if you want to get into the mega man franchise,0
if you are familiar with the mega man series or nes games in general you would know that this is without doubt the most popular and beloved game in the entire franchise and one of the greatest nes games ever made while wouldn go as far to say that this game is the best in the entire series it is fantastic improvement from the previous and definitely one of the best nes games ever made ,1
first game 4 5 5 n second game 4 5 5 5 off for the circus one but still has 2 of my fav cases n third game 5 5,1
i actually played these games on mobile but the only option is 3ds you can definitely tell why this series has lasted so long it got solid concept that it tends to execute pretty well admittedly though actually dislike the second game because don enjoy any of the cases first and third are great though ,1
collection of the first 3 ace attorney games the versions of the games in this collection have uniquely upscaled redrawn art assets which might not be to some fans taste but it was fine for me no cool bonus compilation content this is pretty much just bundle of 3 games this is basically the easiest way to get into the ace attorney series considering the fact that this compilation is on like actually everything these days ,1
the games were so fun to play through but do have to say after while it became unclear what direction the cases even would go and wasn really sure what was gonna happen next ,0
for when these games came out they re pretty good although it felt kinda tedious gathering clues and some of the answers honestly kinda stupid n enjoyed it quite lot before leaving it plan on picking it up again one day tho,1
one of the first games that was given for my playstation 4 was physical copy of n infamous second son n but because my console disc drive got clogged up with dust at one point wasn able to play it or any other physical ps4 game for that matter for years now that finally got that fixed started playing through this game shortly after beating n grand theft auto vice city n and while wouldn consider this to be terrible game wouldn exactly say that liked it n infamous second son n is one of the most aggressively milquetoast games ve ever played as almost everything about it feels designed to be just competent enough to keep the player from switching the game off without actually being all that noteworthy the generic visual style and music really didn help with this as it just made the game generally feel much more bland and flavorless like lot of these kinds of games n infamous second son n focuses on the player having to fight yet another force of tyranny and every plot point and character relationship within that journey is as predictable as they can be none of the characters were very interesting but my least favorite was easily the protagonist because on top of the obviously bad idea of making him be part of fictional native american tribe delsin rowe was also just annoying as his constant quips and one liners consistently got on my nerves ,0
this game is what validated my ps4 back when it came out visually it still looks great with lot of good lighting and particle effects either that or m still just easy to please the plot is pretty cool too as you play as some rebel dude tryin to overthrow the authority with his elemental powers as your character can steal elemental powers from other people there a lot of different abilities you can use and can switch from element to element on the fly so that cool there are also moments where you hold the dualshock 4 controller sideways like spray can to paint stuff and that goes hard love dumb controller gimmicks had good time with this one ,0
any game with protagonist that can shoot stuff out of his hands and is voiced by troy baker is getting good score from me the karma system isn used as good as in the originals but this game still looks and plays fantastic ,1
woosh ,1
i get why lot of people love this game but fundamentally find that no element of the game is good enough to compel me to finish it,1
star wars peak fiction the story is insanely good the combat well good enough imo the designs the immersion and the customising you re able to do is very good you could easily spend life time in this game and still discover more stuff ,1
old review but thought d share ,0
this is my favourite game of all time absolute masterpiece and shall take and cherish these moments for the rest of my life,1

no more heroes 2 is more of the first game but now with more climatic fights and less filler this game completely removes the overworld in between fights although don like these minigames as much as the first game it loses bit of personality in that sense ,0

ot that great ,1
i would sell an intestine for remaster or just port ily suda,1
flower bud and strain u200d ,0
i going to be honest don understand japanese but yeah this game is great just going by the opening hopefully we ll get the remake this year hahahahahah ,1
fucked up game makes you walk and you cope,0
wow spinoff,1
heard they re making video games be good now,1
katamari damacy ia just pure fun once you learn the controls it literally picking up objects as you increase in size so do your pickups racing against time limit is somehow relaxing just sucking up the world with ease ,1
i don have much to say about this game that hasn been repeated for the past almost 20 years it easily one of the best titles on the ps2 maybe one of the greatest games ever made the visuals make me laugh and the music makes me cry the simple concept is just so much fun to play with ,1
honestly one of the textbook examples of what video games can be aesthetically incredible with both the artstyle and soundtrack being sensory feast the gameplay loop is addictive and the controls make it easy to learn but hard to master conceptually it incredibly easy to grasp as your ball starts small and you need to roll things up to be bigger the runtime is perfect length where it neither over nor understays its welcome and there enough challenge stages with hard goals to keep the more hardcore players invested both stylistically and functionally this game rocks and it is must play ,1
all best must have original,1
even as kid could tell this wasn a good game ,1
its basically if you took sonic heroes and ratchet and clank and threw them together but removed all the good parts from each of them plot made no sense and getting to the true ending feels like you are playing the video game version of the endless eight the writing is really funny due to how hard it tries to be edgy but you probably already knew that this game is definitely worth watching the cutscenes for or maybe even doing one of the routes in but going for that final boss or if you are really masochist going for 100 all route variation completion just ain worth it fam damn ,0
this game was one of my favorites growing up but now cannot say the same it is still the best sonic game from that era definitely is but those sonic games kind of suck lot really don like how clunky the gameplay is overall don think liked the gameplay even when was young just thought shadow was cool as heck but that gameplay is super clunky and even if it is an improvement over the other sonic games from this era that doesn mean it is good ,1
too easy but still really fun and beautiful ,1
this game goes through essentially the same story set up three times and was ready to quit the game after the second time through still the mechanics are fun mostly and the art and visuals are great the game is just way too long ,0
never made it past the first few hours of this want to like it because of the art but theres so much boring dialog with the slowest text speed ever created by mankind and repetitive enemy encounters with very shallow combat appreciate what it does but think after point just have to accept m not having fun especially since ive heard its over 60 hours long dont think could trudge through the more boring parts to get to the good parts ,0
we love good comeback,1
liked this better than zero mission its fun game and like all the movement,1
overall great game only have couple of complaints the metroid hunting makes the game little too linear and the remake makes the areas of the game feel circular in design the boss fights are way too tanky and some feel like they drag on forever my final complaint is regard to ridley surprise appearance as the final boss love ridley as much as the next guy but ridley sudden appearance doesn really fit the tone and atmosphere of the game it a cool and fun boss fight but it should have ended with the queen metroid like in the original ,0
another fun metroid game it got great map design item placement and enemy variety while the art design doesnt pop as much as others the level design makes up for it ,1
this has everything loved about dread without the annoying emmi segments ,0
as my first life is strange game enjoyed it ve always had soft spot for these kinds of games ,1
didn like the characters and the dialogues that were kinda cringe the entire time played this game haven finished it but really don feel like doing so the town was kinda nicely designed and the visuals are quite pretty with the watercolor ish artstyle alex power was rather annoying and wasn really that cool ,1
entrega tudo que promete mais um pouco gráfico é excepcional plot é envolvente demais eu nem consigo dizer quanto eu amei soundtrack alex é uma mini querida se não fosse sean a chloe ela seria minha fav de toda franquia motivo de eu ter tirando uma estrela foi por conta daquela criança encapetada filho da namorada do gabe que estragou tudo esse menino é mal do mundo gente que ódio era só ele ter aquietado rabo em casa que nada daquilo teria acontecido ,0
it is the best one music fights story pokemon it a gg,1
what can say the best pokemon game and you get to play it second time in the form of sequel ,1
the most single pokemon game has ever had to offer ,0
pokemon black 2 like white 2 is the only time in the entire franchise they made sequel to mainline game and would argue this is the best pokemon has ever had to offer ,0
one of my favorite games it a simulator like princess maker where you manage the live of streamer girl there many endings depending on your efforts ,0
wacky and fun little game just not my cup of tea it interesting for the first few moments but then it becomes kinda trial and error to figure out all the endings honestly got tired of the gameplay loop not too deep into the game and also lost some of the attachment to the setting of the game even so can see how interesting it can be to have all these possibilities that can lead to unique story paths and find out the crazy endings you can get ,0
this is my joker,0
she just like me fr,1
idk why this game is so popular tbh,1
dated but fun roland going critical bitch had me chuckling few times,0
janky brown and dull at times but it will always hold special place in my heart ,0
 played before 2023 n thinking about it don like the game as much as thought did pandora is seen as boring desert with nothing interesting the psychos were cool but the only unique enemies outside of the dlc guns were okay but not nearly as unique in sequels and the characters just weren interesting think the ones you play as are cool but their skill trees are awfully simply and that makes them feel pretty boring until you get to max level which requires three playthroughs yay think the sequels are lot better ,0
hollow knight simplesmente é maravilhoso prova que jogos indies são feitos com muito mais amor doque aaa é isso que me fez apaixonar por esse jogo,0
 the dynamics of design verisimilitude and anachronism in the video game ,1
night critical examination of cacophony and sanctimony in achieving narrative dynamism it pretty much the best video game ever made real souls like review copied from gametrack,0
this game was genuinely just great experience the platforming segments are great and for the most part are really well designed though some areas not so much love the 2 5d style and how the levels bend and intersect it creates quite unique aesthetic that love n the game overall while challenging at times very rarely gets annoying or frustrating which m very happy with and honestly d say solid 70ish percent of the game had no difficulty at all found some of the late game bosses to be some of my favorite parts of the entire game really love the puzzles as well yet again they re really well designed n think the only issue had and this isn even necessarily an issue with the game is that had bad depth perception so sometimes can really tell how far away thing is if it not on the same plane as klonoa but aside from that this game was an absolute blast to play and its ending is definitely worth it ,0
a mountain of classic 90s charm smooths over some minor flaws in the moment to moment platforming in the tradition of all the best side scrollers your set of abilities is narrow but they are perfectly defined taught and explored to their limits by game end also manages to be forgiving without being easy good stuff ,1
i know this game has lot of reviews already on this site but this was very great game so why not klonoa has always one of those series ve been meaning to try more of but before talk about the game thought d share my history with the series ,1
sensational,1
this was fun time till after 3 2 where levels started to be little bullshit at moments the rings grab is little to short and the bosses are very generic still had fun time just hope 2 is better ,1
broken ,0
considering what you get from this compilation it quite good deal while not every game is stellar work of art they are all fun and you will likely derive some enjoyment from all of them it also serves as historical record spanning over decade of shooter game development ,1
what great collection halo is very much fresh for that time and great building upon its lore ,1
abysmal at launch but 343 managed to turn the mcc around making it one of the best collections out there ,0
transgendered me when was like 9,1
masterpiece,1
bell tower feels like place ve been before idk why n oh yeah had soulsilver when was kid lmao,1
i was worried that the retirement of nathan would leave uncharted without anything to carry story as never considered chloe very interesting character in 2 thankfully lost legacy compensates nicely with shorter story that doesn ask too much of the player while still hitting all the correct beats the gameplay improvements made in 4 make triumphant return though the climbing is still annoying each big set piece is dynamic and exciting the game never lingers too long or moves on too quickly on the open zone section in the beginning have conflicted feelings on one hand the dialouge between chloe and nadine is charming and entertaining without feeling too artificial and enjoyed the scenery however this series has always been about maintaining momentum now have newfound appreciation for the sublime pacing of the older games after experiencing what it feels like to lose that forward moving feeling the game definietly picks up the tempo again afterwards but can say the section left good impression overall the rest of the game is exactly as one would expect the villain is nothing special the platforming is cool and rhytmic but not very complex and there aren really any themes to delve into beyond the absolute minimum stuff don mind though am satisfied with the game being nice adventure to relax with role it easily fulfills ,1
the final uncharted game for now atleast and its fine ,1
everyone told me that uncharted was videogame franchise with no bad games well what do you call this garbage then the story is that chloe hires nadine from the fourth game to help her retrieve ancient indian artifact this is an odd idea for story because chloe knows about nadine ,0

no self imposed challenges or other foolishness with this one for me ve always been bit of flop with this one 3 has been the hardest of the original trilogy for me by large margin so just went for an rank ,0
 played before 2023 n this was my first resident evil experience was probably five or six years old at friends house remember booting the game on easy shooting the first zombie or two with the assault riflt and being so scared that couldn play it few years later actually beat it and enjoyed it but not as much as the second the dodge was cool but way too frustrating to use and while loved exploring the city think that the second half isn as strong because it is basically the same thing as the other two games sewers and lab also didn really like carlos too much honestly and found him annoying and was also missing the city in chaos part you don really see civilians surviving at all which was little detail liked in the remake also felt the game didn feel as replayable even with the zap system which is big focus of the series ,0
obrigado capcom por essa masterpiece,1
man like wanted to like this just as much as 1 and 2 but there are crapton of bad level design and enemy placement choices making this ultimately the most inferior out of the classic trilogy levels are cramped and theres lot of times where you will get ambush sniped by an offscreen zombie hiding behind corner or just zombies in one person wide corridors where you better hope you have the ammo to take them out otherwise you aren getting through nemesis is cool though like the funny zombie guy wish he showed up more frequently and stalked you all throughout the map but the times he does show up can be exciting and the man runs at you like football player which is awesome all in all the game is definitely memorable and worth checking out if you like resident evil stuff but it is definitely the most flawed and occasionally frustrating game of the classic style so beware ,0
um excelente jogo com ótimas ideias uma gameplay claramente superior aos títulos anteriores porém peca em um início confuso áreas redundantes como torre do relógio ganha um pontinho por ter uma história levemente mais novelizada com maior desenvolvimento que os anteriores ,1
this is pretty much rushed continuation to resident evil 2 where it was supposed to be code veronica but ended up being rushed job by the man who made hunk on re2 frustrating challenge mode ,0
very fun game usually n building up huge piles of loot and adventuring in this game is some of the best gaming experiences ive had but it feels like to properly enjoy the game you have to be good enough at the pvp aspect im not honestly only play it in phases but its still really fun each time ,1
good game im just really bad at it unless your not skill issue you will get destoyed,0
a perfect game for those long covid nights where you and the lads would just be pirates for 6 hours at time on grand adventures and making new stories wish there was bit more to this game at times and could never play alone for long but it is still wonderful and love my banjo kazooie ship ,1
shut yuor fucking mouth,0
 played before 2023 n outside of max payne 2 this game has the best slow mo combat out there environmental destruction is great loved playing as fear operator and the enemy ai is amazing my only issue is the healing system is kinda frustrating because you just spam medkits all the time and having limited weapons in this game sucks but most of them aren fun to use also think it would ve been better if they blended the combat and horror together as they are two completely distinct things in game it is also somewhat annoying that the game relies on so many jumpscares few are good but this game took it too far,0
deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as half life and bioshock if not quite the same level of quality exactly ,0
overrated dog shit,0
it unfair how good everything in this game feels ,1
my most replayed game of all time the atmosphere is just unbeatable and the graphics and physics didn age day,1
mafia 1 2002 found dead,0
the story and silly accents are ton of fun this is basically the game wanted a noire to be ,0
haven played the original fully but loved the story here the acting and writing was phenomenal very simple game mechanically as while they open world is beautiful it merely backdrop for the story to take place in some collectibles are hidden throughout the world but didn have much incentive to go after them the 1930 aesthetic is beautiful and driving around is super fun with the more realistic handling compared to gta the gunplay felt little clunky with bit too many bullet sponge enemies got direct head shots that sometimes didn kill instantly also very repetitive structure that can get tiring especially in the latter half of the game definitely worth playing for the story characters and some fun missions ,1
clunky action but the driving is kinda fun city is cool looking ,1
definition of masterpiece ,1
while not as ambitious or polished as it sequel and with lot of its ideas going fairly unexplored nier still ends up being an emotionally engaging rpg with lot more of personal connection when compared to automata ,1
the closest game there is to texhnolyze in all the best ways ,0
an interesting story with decent main missions and extremely tedious side quests the flow and feel of movement and combat are janky yet satisfying the game definitely does not respect your time but it looking to tell different kind of story than its contemporaries probably not really worth playing through nowadays when the superior remake replicant is available other than the superior soundtrack ,1
played this right after automata you can clearly see how it kind of sketch of what automata ended up being or at least automata takes all the ideas explored here and handles them better notably the routes endings system n read lot about it before actually playing about how the story was great but gameplay was horrendous but it not that bad imo was not particularly attached to automata gameplay anyway the boring part is more about the different routes when you go for the final ending you basically skip every cutscene and speerun everything even more if you decide to do both and n despite this game broken and unpolished aspect it holds special place in my hearth immediately fell in love with the characters ost is beautiful and while the story can be bit of tearjerker honestly even the sidequests are like that it still really works and has very memorable moments ,0
 played before 2023 n the characters and choices aren as strong but as someone who thought that would hate playing as clementine was completely wrong really enjoyed it lot and think that the choice at the end was much stronger ending in terms of being based off your actions but definitely didn hit the same as the original ,1
clementine proves she can hold her own as main character in this follow up feels like it is missing bit of the magic of the original but still stressful journey through kirkman world ,0
everything about thisgame is amazing,1
the first game is so good and just never clicked with this one it good but it doesn hit as hard ,1
so let me get this straight just wasted 100 million dollars and sank an entire studio all with my freaking mind ,0
felt like was in fever dream of history class have so much knowledge about world could not give single shit about the cuff thing was pretty interesting but the story was predictable and probably the worst part about the game told in insanely boring way n set me frey,0
it safe to say that forspoken ended up major critical and commercial failure for square enix what with the very mixed reception from critics and the studio behind this game no longer in existence with all that said was this failure warranted ,0
a game with good ideas and cool enemies bogged down by terrible dialogue and terrible optimization very sad ,0
kızın harbiden 3 cümlesinden biri küfür,0
sadly lot of wasted potential ,0
it the same augugughhh,0
the most romantic game of all time ,1
fantastic game that took everything that the original game had improved on all of the positive qualities and fixed all of the issues had an updated engine and budget really made this shine despite the short length and all of the little details in the environment are great the shooting is stunning the combat is perfected the voice acting is stellar and overall this is one of remedy best games and an argument for their magnum opus which is saying something ,1
o famoso caso da sequencia que melhora em tudo ao seu antecessor n não tenho muito que falar jogo é basicamente 1 mas melhora todos os aspectos fracos ou mediano n o melhor é não temos mais max com cara do sam lake ,0
boring ass game,0
amazing game,1
cool game ,1
good game buy now,1
it definitely an acquired taste and can 100 understand why people dislike this game ,0
dusk foi uma grata surpresa pra mim ele consegue mesclar momentos de ação terror muito bem seu personagem é extremamente rápido nunca falta munição ainda assim jogo consegue manter uma atmosfera assustadora quando quer os ambientes são variados a trilha som do jogo se destacam também,0
a boomer esque shooter with low graphics and fast movement some of the most fun had playing an fps blasting enemies with shotgun feels amazing,1

objectively this game is higher but cannot get into it ,0

i really like this game but once was done kind of had no desire to continue which for this kind of game which is short and should be 100 ed wish had more of an incentive to get my score up and try cooler things because lot of the actual missions seem annoying ,0
very fun arcade skater shooter tony hawk pro shooter plus bullet time,1
bruh everything is so smooth and so fun to discover master in this one from the artstyle to the underlying thematics of revolution just like its inspiration rollerball,1
this game was more fun on paper than with the controller in my hands the gameplay loop started to drag for me and the movement was sometimes frustrating ,0
