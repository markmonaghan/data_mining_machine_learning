# Milestones

## Week 2

Group decided to focus on datasets across the Entertainment space, as its an industry we're familiar with and the datasets were more straightforward to interpret, compared with some others which would have required domain specific knowledge. Initial datasets chosen for analysis:
* Music – Top Spotify songs 2010 – 2019 by year
* Movies – Top 10 Grossing movies (1975 – 2018)
* Video Games – Popular video games 1980 – 2023

The group decided to create individual branches in GitHub and to work individually on those, and regularly merge into the main branch. Every merge would need at least one approver to review proposed changes, feedback points etc would be recorded in GitHub.

## Week 3

Chose a different music dataset, the initial Spotify dataset had potential licensing issues and was missing key features to meet the objectives.
Mark and Rami both assigned to do Decision Trees, Harry clustering, Rohith CNN and Rishav neural network.
Presented initial idea to lab helpers in the Wednesday lab session, got approval to progress.

## Week 4

Focus on cleaning and preprocessing the datasets.

Group decided to try to complete the first draft of models and the READ.me by week 8, and have a meeting all together to review everyones work collectively. This would provide sufficient time to act on any feedback points from the session.

## Week 5

Continuation of dataset proprocessing and several of the team members started working on the models.

## Week 6

No meetings during reading week.

## Week 7

Focus mainly on model development. 

Lab helper reviewed the proposed READ.me format in the lab session. Feedback was positive so the team agreed to use a standard format and headings for everyones contribution to the READ.me

## Week 8

Group review session to review the work completed so far. Main improvement points centred around adding appropriate visualisations and how to present the results in tables/graphs.

Reviewed the specification to make sure each of the requirements are being met.

## Week 9

Brainstorm on what information should be included in the group presentation, started working on the slides.

## Weeks 10 & 11

Completion of any outstanding work and the READ.me.

Slides completed for presentation.
